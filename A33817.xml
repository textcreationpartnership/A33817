            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE CONCERNING A GUIDE IN MATTERS OF FAITH.</head>
                  <p>THE deſign of this Diſcourſe is the Reſolution of the following <hi>Query.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whither a Man who liveth where Chriſtianity is <note place="margin">The Queſtion</note> profeſſed, and refuſeth to ſubmit his judgment to the Infallibility of any Guide on Earth, and particularly to the Church or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath, notwithſtanding that refuſal, ſufficient means ſtill left him whereby he may arrive at certainty in thoſe Doctrines which are generally neceſſary to the Salvation of a Chriſtian Man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Satisfaction in this Inquiry is of great Moment. For <note place="margin">The moment of this Queſtion.</note> it relateth to our great end, and to the way which leads to it. And it nearly concerneth both the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the <hi>Reformed.</hi> If there be not ſuch a <hi>Guide,</hi> the Eſtate of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is extreamly dangerous. For then the Blind take the Blind for their unerring Leaders; and being once miſled, they wander on without correcting their Error, having taken up this firſt as their fixed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that their <hi>Guide</hi> cannot miſtake the way. On the other hand,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98824:6"/> If God hath ſet up in his Church a Light ſo very clear and ſteddy as is pretended; the <hi>Reformed</hi> are guilty of great preſumption, and expoſe themſelves to great uncertainty, by ſhutting their Eyes againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Now, there lyes before Men a double Temptation to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <note place="margin">The Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to believe the Affirmative part of this Queſtion.</note> of the being of ſuch a Guide in the Chriſtian Church; <hi>Sloth</hi> and Vitious <hi>Humility</hi> of mind. <hi>Sloth</hi> inclineth Men rather to take up in an Implicit Faith, then to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble of a ſtrict Examination of things.

                     </gap>lity, then in bending of the Head by long and ſtrict Attention and ſevere Study.</p>
                  <p>Alſo there is a Shew of Humility, in the deference which our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings pay unto Authority; eſpecially to that which pretends to be under Chriſt, Supreme on Earth. Although, in the paying of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good reaſon fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Temptations prevail not upon honeſt and conſiderate Minds, which inquire, without prejudice, <note place="margin">The true Reſolution of the Query.</note> after Truth, and ſubmit to the Powerful Evidence of it. Such will reſolve the Queſtion in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and they may reaſonably ſo do by conſidering theſe propoſitions which I ſhall treat of in their order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Chriſtian Church never yet wanted, nor ſhall it ever want, either the Doctrines of neceſſary Faith, or the Belief and Profeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereſoever GOD requireth the Belief of them, he giveth means ſufficient for Information and unerring Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This one Faith never did, nor ever ſhall in all places fail.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles were themſelves without error both in their own aſſent to the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith, and in the delivery of them.</p>
                  <p>They heard the Oracles of Chriſt from his own mouth, and they were Witneſſes of his Reſurrection; And they ſpake <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 4. 19, 20.</note> what they <hi>had ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi> And they gave to the World Aſſurance of the Truth, by the miraculous ſigns of their Apoſtolical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And if they had not had ſuch Aſſurance themſelves, and could not have given proof to others of their miſſion, there would have been a defect in the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel; and ſuch as could not afterwards have been amended. That which, at firſt, had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with uncertainty, would, with greater uncertainty, have been conveighed down to after Ages; and Men, who, in proceſs of time, graft error upon certain Truth, would much more have grafted error up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uncertain Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Ever ſince the Apoſtles times there has been True Faith, and the Profeſſion of it in the Catholick Church: And it will be ſo till Faith ſhall expire, and Men ſhall ſee him on whom they before believ'd. For a Church cannot ſubſiſt without the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity. And Chriſt hath Sealed this Truth with his promiſe, that there ſhall be a Church as long as this World continues. <note n="*" place="margin">S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.</note> I mean by a Church a viſible Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Chriſtians both Miniſters and People; for publick Worſhip on Earth cannot be inviſible.</p>
                  <p>But the True Faith and the Profeſſion of it is not fixed to any place, or to any ſucceſſion of Men in it. God's Providence has written the contrary in the very Aſhes of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is any particular Church, though ſo far infallible in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals as to be preſerved from actual error, an infallible Rule to all other Chriſtians. If they follow the Doctrine of it, they erre not, becauſe it is true; but if they follow that Church as an unerring Guide or Canon, they miſtake in the Rule and Motive of their Faith. For that particular Church which Teacheth Truth, might poſſibly have err'd; and the Church which erres, might have ſhined with the True Light. But the whole Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in any Age; for then the very being of a Church would ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth it, hence, follow, that the Faith of the Roman Church, when <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, was the only true and certain Doctrine. For that Church was not then the only viſible Church on Earth. The <hi>Greek</hi> Church (for inſtance ſake) was then more viſible than now it is, and more Orthodox: The Rich Papacy having much prevailed upon the neceſſities of it by Arguments guilded with Intereſt. That Church did not erre in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Points; the Article of the <hi>Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Son, which the <hi>Romans</hi> accuſe of Hereſie, being eaſily acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it, if Men, agreeing in the ſenſe, forbear contention about the Phraſes. Beſides, if our Fore-Fathers under the Papacy embraced the True Faith, we have it ſtill, the <hi>Faith</hi> not being removed, but the <hi>Corruption.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſeen that neceſſary Faith is perpetual, and it is as <note place="margin">Prop. II</note> manifeſt that <hi>whereſoever God requireth the belief of it, he vouchſafeth ſufficient means for information, and unerring Aſsent.</hi>

                  <p>Of all he does not require this belief, for to all the Goſpel is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where it is preached there are Infants, and Perſons of Age ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered in Mind, as to remain unavoidably Children in underſtanding.</p>

The Articles of Chriſtian Religion come not to the Mind by natural reaſon, but by Faith; and Faith comes by hearing or reading; and where theſe means are not offered, a Man is rather an Ignorant Perſon then an Unbeliever.

                  <p>The means, then, are ſufficient whereſoever the end <note place="margin">Prop.

And ſeing ſuch a one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had without God's ſupernatural aſſiſtance, the moſt knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men being ſubject both to Error and to Falſhood; it is great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, whilſt the Scripture is ſilent, to ſay he is in beeing. And to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that if there were not ſuch a Guide, God would be wanting in means ſufficient for the maintenance of Peace and Truth, is preſumptuouſly to obtrude the ſchemes of Man's fancy upon God's Wiſdom. He can Govern his Church without our methods.</p>
                  <p>Now, God <hi>hath no where promiſed ſuch a Judge to Chriſtian Men;</hi> though he hath promiſed help on Earth, and aſſiſtance from Heaven, to Men dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and ſincere in their inquiries after truths which are neceſſary for them. There are <hi>two places</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are by ſome taken for <hi>promiſes</hi> of ſuch a nature, though they were not, by the Divine Wiſdom, ſo intended.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe, the <hi>Firſt</hi> is that which was ſpoken by Chriſt unto <hi>St. Peter.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt</hi> (the Church.)</p>
                  <p>Which Promiſe concerneth the Church in general, and the neceſſary Faith of it, and not any particular perſons, or places, or ſucceſſions of perſons in them.</p>
                  <p>And Chriſt doth here aſſure us, that <hi>the Gates of the Grave,</hi> ſhall not ſwallow up the Church; that it ſhall not enter in at them; <hi>that it ſhall not die or periſh</hi> But he doth not ſay he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it by the means of any Earthly infallible Guide. He can, by other waves, continue it till time it ſelf ſhall fail.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> place of <hi>Scripture</hi> is, the promiſe of Chriſt a little while before his Aſcenſion into the Heavens. <note n="†" place="margin">S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.</note>

And for the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi> who firſt ſucceeded S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they have a much fairer pretence then thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Truth is, <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was properly the Mother-church: Though <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial city; and if, by this means, the Popes had not ſate higher, they would not have pretended to ſee farther then others.</p>

It is manifeſt to every Learned Man that the Eyes of the Pope are not (metaphorically) like thoſe of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in which (it is ſaid) there appeared a brightneſs like that of the Sun. If we had more of their Hiſtory, and more of their Writings, we ſhould find more of their errors.

                  <p>I will haſten to the next Propoſition, after I have added one thing more which relates to the guidance of Eccleſiaſtical Authority: And it is this. Thoſe of the unlearned. Laity who are Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have much more of the juſt guidance of Eccleſiaſtical Authority than the like order of Men in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Authentick Books of that Church being all written in the Latin Tongue the illiterate People reſolve their Faith into the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and honeſty of their Confeſſor or Pariſh Prieſt. They take it upon his word, that this is the Doctrine this the Diſcipline, this the Worſhip, of their Church. Whereas each Miniſter in our Church can direct the People to the Holy Bible, to the Books of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Articles, Canons, Common-Prayer, Ordination, as ſet forth in their native Tongue, by publick Authority. Of this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98824:17"/> they may be aſſured by their own Eyes, as many as can but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently read. They do not only take this from the mouth of a Prieſt, but from the Church it ſelf. Where the Laws of the Church and the Statutes of the Civil Government are written in an unknown Tongue, there the Unlearned depend more upon private than publick Authority; for they receive the Law from particular Prieſts or Judges.</p>
                  <p>Though Eccleſiaſtical Authority be a help to our <note place="margin">Prop. VI.</note> Faith, yet the Holy Scripture is the only infallible Rule of it; and by this Rule and the Miniſteral Aids of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, we have ſufficient means without Submiſſion to papal Infallability, to attain to certainty in that Faith which is generally neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean that, by believing the whole Canon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the groſs, we thereby believe all the neceſſary Articles of the Faith, becauſe they are therein contained. That looks too like a fallacy; and it giveth countenance to an uſeleſs Faith. For he that believes on this manner, hath as it were ſwallow'd a Creed in the lump only, whereas it is neceſſary for a Chriſtian to know each particular Article and the general Nature &amp; Tendency of it. Otherwiſe his Faith will not have a diſtinct influence upon his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian behaviour to which if it were not uſeful, it were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To believe in general as the Scripture believes, is with the Blind and Flexible Faith of a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> to believe at adventure. He believes as his Church believes, but he knows not what is the belief of his Church; and therefore is not inſtructed by that Faith to behave himſelf as a Member of it.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is that rule of Faith which giveth us all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles which are neceſſary to eternal Life.</p>

                  <p>It is commonly ſaid by Men of the <hi>Roman</hi> perſwaſion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly enough, that we may as well receive our Creed from them, as we do our Bible. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> might have ſaid the like to the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But with the good Text, they conveighed down to them a very falſe gloſs, and miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Propheſies, as meant of a pompous temporal <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But, for the Reformed, they have received neither Creed nor Bible from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt enumeration of thoſe Books they find in the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Canons and in thoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Laodecea;</hi> no <hi>Weſtren</hi> writings. They have received the Scriptures from the Univerſal Church of all Ages and Places, the Copies of them having been as widely diſperſed as the Chriſtians themſelves. And they receive them not from the infallibility of any particular Church, but upon the validity of this ſure principle, that all the Chriſtian World, ſo widely diſperſed, could not poſſibly conſpire in the impoſing of falſe Books upon them.</p>
                  <p>For particular Churches, we may, of all others ſuſpect the <hi>Roman,</hi> in reference to the Scriptures.

But, it ſeems, he was not exact enough in this change of words. For he having overlooked ſome words which were uſed by the <hi>Genevians</hi> and not the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> a diſcovery was made by the Divines of <hi>Paris,</hi> and this Edition of the Bible was condemned by them, though publiſhed under the name of one of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay that ſuch places of Scripture as contain Matters of Faith, are plain to every Man. But thoſe who have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of capacity, who are not prejudiced againſt the Truth, who pray to God for his aſſiſtance, who attend to what they read, who uſe the Miniſterial helps which are offered to them, ſhall find enough in Holy Writ to Guide them to everlaſting life. In finding out the ſenſe of the Scriptures, the Church gives them help, but it does not, by its Authority, obtrude the ſenſe upon them. The Guides of it are as Expoſitors and School-Maſters to them: And by comparing phraſe with phraſe, and place with place, and by other ſuch wayes, they teach them how to judge of the meaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They give them light into the nature of the Doctrine, they do not require them to take it upon truſt. They endeavour to open their underſtandings that they may, themſelves, underſtand the Scriptures. And if they cannot themſelves underſtand the Doctrine, it will be of little uſe to them in their lives. For they then believe in general that it is a neceſſary Truth; but what Truth it is, or for what ends it is neceſſary, they apprehend not.

Some of our Clergy have already been ſo charitable to our Diſſenters, as to warn them of their danger, and by the Strength and Evidence of Scripture and Reaſon, to Convince them of their miſtakes; and I pray God forgive thoſe men, and turn their Hearts, who will not contribute ſo much to their own Conviction and Satisfaction, as diligently and impartially to read and conſider what is ſo charitably offered to them.

                  <p>And now it might juſtly be thought want of charity to thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> communion, ſhould we take no care at all of them; nay, want of charity to thoſe of our own communion, and to Diſſenters themſelves, who are daily aſſaulted by the buſie Factors for <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Diſputes againſt the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as againſt Diſſenters, are for the moſt part too Learned, and too Voluminous for the inſtruction of ordinary People, and therefore ſome ſhort and plain Diſcourſes about the principal Matters in diſpute between us, is the moſt effectual way we can take to confirm men in their Religion, and preſerve them from the crafty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of ſuch as lie in wait to deceive.</p>
                  <p>Some few Attempts, which have been already made of that kind, give me ſome hope, that ſeveral other Tracts will follow, that the ruine of the church of <hi>England</hi> (if God ſhall pleaſe ever to permit ſuch a thing) whither by Popery, or Phanaticiſm, may not be charged upon our neglect to inſtruct People better.</p>
                  <p>Some Perſons, it ſeems, whoſe Talent lies more in cenſuring what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, then in doing any good themſelves, are pleaſed to put ſome ſiniſter conſtructions on this Deſign; as it is impoſible to deſign any

                     </gap> reaſon any man has to be aſhamed to own it, though it were part of his deſign; but whither it is or not, is more then I know; I dare undertake for thoſe Perſons I am acquainted with, that they neither value the favour, nor fear the diſpleaſure either of Phanaticks or Papiſts, but yet heartily deſire to do good to them both.</p>
                  <p>But there is a more miſchievous ſuggeſtion then this, that the deſign of ſuch Papers is only to raiſe a new cry, and noiſe about Popery, and to alarm the People, and diſturb the Government with new Fears and Jealouſies: Truly, if I thought this would be the effect of it, I would burn my Papers preſently; for I am ſure the church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will get nothing by a Tumultuary and clamorous Zeal againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I had much rather ſuffer under Popery, then contribute any thing towards raiſing a Popular Fury to keep it out.

But when we find our People Aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Agents of <hi>Rome,</hi> and do not think our ſelves ſecure from Popiſh Deſigns, we think it our Duty to give them the beſt Inſtructions we can to preſerve them from ſuch Errors, as we believe will deſtroy their Souls; and cannot but wonder, that any men, who are as much concerned to take care of Souls as we are; ſhould think this a needleſs or a ſcandalous undertaking. I wiſh ſuch men would ſpeak out, and tell us plainly, what they think of Popery themſelves. If they think this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not well managed, by thoſe who undertake it, it would more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them to commend the Deſign, and do it better themſelves. I know no man, but would very gladly be excuſed, as having other work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to imploy his time, but yet I had rather ſpend my vacant minutes this way, then in cenſuring the good that other men do, while I do none my ſelf.</p>

                  <head>The Words of the Paper, which was ſent to me are theſe.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IT is my Opinion that the infinite Goodneſs of our Legiſlator, has left to us a means of knowing the true ſenſe and meaning of the Holy Scriptures, which is the Church: Now J judge this Church muſt be known to be the true Church, by its continual viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt till our Dayes. But I doubt whither or no the Proteſtant Church can make out this continual viſible Succeſſion, and deſire to be informed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANSWER.</p>
                  <p>THAT Chriſt has leſt a means of knowing the true ſenſe and meaning of the Holy Scriptures, I readily grant; or elſe it had been to no purpoſe to have left us the Scriptures. But the latter Clauſe is very ambiguous, for the meaning may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, that we may underſtand by the Scriptures, which is the Church; or that the Church is the means whereby we muſt underſtand the true ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a true Proteſtant Principle, and therefore I preſume not intended by this Objector. For how we ſhould know that there is any Church without the Information we receive by the Scripture, I cannot Divine; and yet we may as eaſily know that there is a Church, as we can know which is the true Church without the Scripture. For there is no other means of knowing, either that there is a Church, or what this Church is, or what are the Properties of a True and Sound and Orthodox Church, but by Revelation, and we have no other Revelation of this but what is contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>As for the Second, That the Church is the means of knowing the true ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures, it is in ſome ſenſe very true, in ſome ſenſe very falſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is in ſome ſenſe true, and acknowledged by all ſober
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98824:23"/> Proteſtants. As, 1. If by the Church we underſtand the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church of all Ages, as we receive the Scriptures themſelves handed down by them to our time, ſo what ever Doctrines of Faith have been univerſally received by them, is one of the beſt means to find out the true ſenſe of Scripture. For the nearer they were to the times of the Apoſtles, the more likely they were to underſtand the true ſenſe of their Writings, being inſtructed by the Apoſtles themſelves in the meaning of them. And thus we have a certain Rule to ſecure us from all dangerous Errors in expounding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the great and fundamental Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, are as plainly contained in the Writings of the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and as unanimouſly aſſerted by them, as the Authority of the Scriptures themſelves: and therefore though we have not a Traditionary Expoſition of every particular Text of Scripture; yet we have of the great and fundamental Doctrines of Faith, and therefore muſt never expound Scripture ſo as to contradict the known and avowed ſenſe of the Catholick Church. And this courſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> takes; ſhe receives the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of the four firſt General Councils, and requires her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clorgy to Expound the Scriptures according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Doctrines of thoſe firſt and pureſt Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ought to pay great deference to, and not lightly and want only oppoſe the Judgement and Authority of the Particular Church, wherein we live, when her Expoſitions of Scripture do not evidently and notoriouſly contradict the ſenſe of the Catholick church, eſpecially of the firſt and beſt Ages of it. For it does not become private men to oppoſe their Sentiments and Opinions to the Judgement of the church, unleſs in ſuch plain caſes, as every honeſt man may be preſumed a very competent Judge in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and no church, nor all the churches in the World have ſuch Authority, that we muſt renounce our ſenſes, and deny the firſt principles of Reaſon, to follow them with a blind and implicite Faith.</p>
                  <p>And thus the church, that is, the ſenſe and Judgment of the catholick church, is a means for the finding out the true ſenſe of Scripture; and though we may miſtake the ſenſe of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Texts, (which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves will not deny, but that even infallible councils may do, who tho' they are infallible in their concluſions, yet are not alwayes ſo in the Arguments or Mediums, whither drawn from Scripture or Reaſon, whereby they prove them) yet it is Morally impoſſible we ſhould be guilty of any dangerous miſtake, while we make the catholick Doctrine of the church our Rule; and in other matters follow the Judgment, and ſubmit to the Authority of the church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live; which is as abſolutely neceſſary, as Peace and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98824:24"/> Order and good Goverment in the church,</p>
                  <p>2. But then this is very falſe, if we mean that the church is the only means of finding out the true ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; on if by the church we underſtand any particular church, as I ſuppoſe this Perſon does, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, that is, the particular univerſal church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or if we mean the church of the preſent Age, or by Means underſtand, ſuch a Decretory ſentence, as muſt determine our Faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand out Aſſent; that we muſt ſeek for no other Reaſon of our Faith, but the Authority of the church in expounding Scriptures. I ſhall diſcourſe ſomething briefly of each of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſay that the church is the only Means to find out the true ſenſe of Scripture, is very falſe and abſurd. For, 1. This ſuppoſes the Holy Scriptures to be a very unintelligible Book, which is a great reproach to the Holy Spirit, by which it was Indited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he either could not, or would not ſpeak intelligibly to the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a direct contradiction to thoſe Exhortations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles to ſtudy the Scriptures, which were made to private Men, and therefore neceſſarly ſuppoſes, that the Holy Scriptures are to be underſtood as other Writtings are, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Propriety of the Words and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nguage wherein they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the ſcope and deſign of the place, and ſuch other means; as honeſt and ſtudious Inquirers uſe to find out the meaning of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Scriptures are ſo unintelligible, that an honeſt man cannot find out the meaning of them, without the infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church, I would deſire to know whither Chriſt and his Apoſtles Preach'd intelligibly to their Hearers? If they did not, to what purpoſe did they Preach at all? By what means were men Converted to the Faith? If they did, how come theſe Sermons to be ſo unintelligible now they are written, which were ſo intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible when they were ſpoken? For the Goſpels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a plain Hiſtory of what Chriſt did, and of what he ſaid; and the Apoſtles Wrote the ſame things to the Churches when they were abſent, which they Preach'd to them when they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and we reaſonably ſuppoſe, that they as much deſigned that the Churches ſhould underſtand what they wrote, as what they Preach'd, and therefore that they generally uſed the ſame form of words in their writting and in their Preaching: And this makes it a great Riddle, how one ſhould be very plain and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and the other ſignifie nothing without an infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Scriptures be in themſelves unintelligible, I would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98824:24"/> deſire to know how the Church comes to underſtand them? If by any humane means, together with the ordinary Aſſiſtances of the Divine Spirit, then they are to be underſtood, and then why may not every Chriſtian in proportion to his skill in Language<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and in the Rules of Reaſon and Diſcourſe, underſtand them alſo?</p>
                  <p>If the Church cannot underſtand the Scriptures by any humane means, but only by Inſpiration, (for there is no Medium between theſe two) to what purpoſe were the Scriptures written? For we might as well have learn'd the will of God from the Church, without the Scriptures; as with them. GOD could have immediately revealed his will to the Church without a written Rule, as well as reveal the meaning of that written Rule, which it ſeems has no ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all, till the Church, by Inſpiration, gives an Orthodox meaning to it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we cannot underſtand the Scriptures, till the Church Expounds them to us, how ſhal we know, which is the Church, and that this Church is ſuch an infallible Interpreter of Scriptures? The Church is to be known only by the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only by the Church; if we will know the Church, we muſt firſt underſtand the Scriptures, and if we will underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we muſt firſt know the Church, and when both muſt be known firſt, or we can know neither, it is impoſſible in this way; either to underſtand the Scriptures, or find out the Church.</p>
                  <p>For, ſuppoſe the Church does expound Scripture by Inſpiration; how ſhall we be aſſured that it does ſo? Muſt we believe every Man, or every Church, which pretends to Inſpiration? This is a contradiction to the Apoſtles Rule, not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits. How then ſhall they be tried? I know but two wayes, either by Miracles, or by Scripture, Miracles are now ceaſ'd, unleſs we will believe ſome fabulous Legends, which all wiſe men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are aſhamed of; and if there were real Miracles wrought, they are of no Authority againſt a ſtanding Rule of Faith, which the Apoſtle calls a <hi>more ſure word of Propheſie.</hi> If then we muſt judge of theſe pretences to Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Scriptures, which is the only way now left, then there is a way of underſtanding the Scriptures without this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if we muſt underſtand the Scriptures by Revelation, and Revelation by the Scriptures, we are got into a new Circle and can underſtand neither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But do we not ſee how many Schiſms and Hereſies have been occaſioned, by ſuffering every one to Expound Scripture for himſelf? How many Diviſions and Sub-diviſions are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proteſtants, who agree in little elſe, beſides their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Popery? And is it poſſible to cure this without an

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? Is it not a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to common Experience, to ſay, that the ſenſe of Scripture is plain and certain, when ſo few men can agree what it is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Yes, we do ſee this, and lament it, and are beholden to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Emiſſaries in a great meaſure for it. But yet we know, thus it has been in all Ages of the Chriſtian Church, as well as now; and we take the ſame way to confute theſe Hereſies, and to preſerve the purity of the Faith, and the Unity of the Church, which the Primitive Fathers did, by appealing to Scripture, and the Doctrine and Practice of the Catholick Church which is the beſt way any Church can take, when there is no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge of controverſies: And if the Primitive Church had known any ſuch infallible Judge, they would certainly have appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, at one time or other; and it had been impoſſible, that any Errors or Hereſies ſhould for any long time together have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the Church: but we hear nothing of him for many hundred years after Chriſt; but the ancient Fathers took the ſame way to confute the Hereſies of their dayes, which we do now, which is a good proable Argument, that they knew no better. And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diviſions of the Chriſtian Church, are no greater Argument againſt us, then the Ancient Hereſies were againſt the Primitive Church, or then the Proteſtant Hereſies (as they are pleaſed to call them) are againſt the church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For what advantage has the church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon this account above any other profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians. Thoſe who are of the ſame communion are of the ſame Mind. Thus it is among us, and it is no better among them; for we are no more of their mind, then they are of ours; nay notwithſtanding all their pretences to infallibility, moſt of the Diſputes, which divide the Proteſtant churches, are as fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted among themſelves, witneſs the famous controverſie between the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts;</hi> which their infallible Judge never thought fit to determine to this day: They live indeed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the ſame church, notwithſtanding theſe Diſputes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a very dangerous thing to leave it; but they are more beholden to the Inquiſition, then to infallibility for this Unity.</p>
                  <p>2. How do theſe Diviſions and Hereſies, which diſturb the Church, prove, that no man can be certain of his Religion? If we can certainly know what the ſenſe of Scripture is, notwithſtanding there are many different Opinions about it, then the diverſity of Opinions is no Argument againſt us; if we cannot be certain of any thing, which others deny, diſpute, or doubt of, then how can any Papiſt be certain that his Church is infallible? For all the reſt of the Chriſtian Church deny this, and ſcorn their Pretenſions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98824:25"/> to it. I may indeed ſafely acquieſce in the Determinations of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge, whom I am infallibly aſſured to be infallible, how many contrary Opinions ſoever there are in the World; But when infallibility it ſelf is the matter of the diſpute, and I have no infallible way to know whither there be any ſuch thing, or where this infallibility is ſeated, if diverſity of Opinions be an Argument againſt the certainty of any thing, which I am not, and cannot be infallibly aſſured of, then it is a certain demonſtration againſt infallibility it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs we will take the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> word for her own infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, we cannot have the Deciſion of an infallible Judge in this matter, for ſhe will allow no other infallible Judge, but her ſelf; and yet this is ſo abſurd a way, that it ſuppoſes, that we believe, and that we diſ-believe the ſame thing at the ſame time. For unleſs we before-hand believe the Church to be infallible, her ſaying ſo is no infallible proof that ſhe is infallible; and yet the very demand of a proof ſuppoſes that we are not certain of it, that we doubt of it, or diſ-believe it. When we ask the Church whither ſhe be infallible, it ſuppoſes that we are not certain of it, otherwiſe we ſhould need no proof; and when we believe the Church to be infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſayes ſo, it ſuppoſes, that we did before-hand believe that ſhe is infallible, otherwiſe, her ſaying ſo is no proof.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt Champions for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> never preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they could produce any infallible proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the true Church. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> attempts no more, then to alledge ſome Motives of Credibility, to make the thing probable, and to incline Men to believe it; and yet it is impoſſible we can be more certain of the Infallibility of the Church, then we are, that it is a true Church; and if a Papiſt have only ſome motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, to believe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a true Church, he can have no greater probabilities, that it is an infallible Church.</p>
                  <p>Now not to take notice, what a tottering Foundation ſome high probabilities, though they amounted to a moral aſſurance, is for the belief of infallibility, which is to put more in the Concluſion then there is in the Premiſes. The only uſe I ſhall make of it at preſent is this, That we can at leaſt be as certain of the meaning of Scripture, as the Papiſts are, that their Church is infallible, for they can be no more infallibly aſſured of this, then we are of our interpretations of Scripture; and therefore, if the diverſity of Opinions about the ſenſe of Scriptures, proves that we cannot be certain what the true ſenſe of it is, the ſame Argument proves, that they cannot be certain that their Church is
<pb facs="tcp:98824:26"/> infallible, becauſe this is not only doubted, but abſolutly denied by the greateſt part of the Chriſtian World, and was never thought of by the beſt and pureſt Ages of it. So this Argument proves too much, and recoils upon themſelves, like a Gun which is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and if, for their own ſakes, they will grant that we may be certain of ſome things, which are as confidently denied, and diſputed by others; then the diverſity of Opinions in the Church, is no Argument, that we cannot be certain of our Religion, but only teacheth us greater caution, and diligence, and Honeſty, in our inquiries after Truth.</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe Diviſions and Hereſies that are in the Chriſtian Church, are no better Argument againſt the truth and certainty of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then the diverſities of Religions that are in the World, are againſt the truth of Chriſtianity. The whole World is far enough from being Chriſtian; great part of it are <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> or <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> ſtill; and this is as good an Argument, to prove the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all Religions, as the different Parties and Profeſſions of Chriſtians are to prove, that we cannot be certain, what the true Chriſtian Church, nor what true Chriſtianity is. The Goſpel of our Saviour was not deſigned to offer any force or violence to mens Faith or underſtanding, no more then to their wills. Were there ſuch an irreſiſtible and compulſory Evidence in the Goſpel, that wherever it was Preach'd, it ſhould be impoſſible for any man, though never ſo wicked and ill diſpoſed, to continue an Infidel, or to prove a Heretick, Faith would be no greater a Vertue, then forc'd Obedience and Compliance is. The Goſpel has Evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Convince honeſt Minds, and is plain enough to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by thoſe who are honeſt and teachable; and therefore has its Effects upon thoſe who are Curable, which is all that it was deſigned for. Thoſe, who will not beleive, may continue Infidels, and thoſe, who will not underſtand, may fall into Errours, and believe a Lye; and yet there is Evidence enough to Convince, and Plainneſs enough to Inſtruct well diſpoſed minds, and certainty enough in each to be the foundation of a Divine Faith.</p>
                  <p>The ſum is this, Though the Inſtructions of the Church are a very good means for the underſtanding of the ſenſe of Scripture, yet they are not the only means; the Holy Scripture is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Book, in ſuch matters as are abſolutly neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and could we ſuppoſe, that a man, who never heard of a Church, ſhould have the uſe of the Bible, in a Language which he underſtood, by a diligent reading of it, he might underſtand enough to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>2. If by Church is mean'd any Particular Church; as ſuppoſe the
<pb facs="tcp:98824:26"/> 
                     <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, or the Church of the preſent Age, it is abſolutely falſe to ſay, that the Church, in this ſenſe, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a ſure and ſafe means of underſtanding the Scripture. What has been Univerſally believed by all Chriſtian Churches, in all Ages, or at leaſt, by all Churches of the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. which were neareſt the times of the Apoſtles, and might be preſumed beſt to underſtand the ſenſe of the Apoſtles in the great Articles of our Faith, is a very ſafe Rule for the interpretation of Scripture; and the general Practice of thoſe Primitive Apoſtolick Churches, in matters of Government and Diſcipline, before they were corrupted by worldly Ambition, and ſecular Intereſt, is a very ſafe Rule for our Practice alſo, and this is the Rule whereby our Church is reformed, and to which we appeal.</p>
                  <p>There are but three things neceſſary to be underſtood by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, either the Articles of Faith or the Rules of Life, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Order and Diſcipline of the Church, and Adminiſtration of Religious Offices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the Rules of Life, all thoſe Duties which we owe to GOD and Men, they are ſo plainly contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that no honeſt man can miſtake them; I ſuppoſe the church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, will not pretend, that there is any need of an infallible Interpreter to teach men what is mean'd by Loving GOD with all our Heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the Articles of Faith, thoſe which are fundamental to the chriſtian Religion, and which every Chriſtian ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are ſo plain in Scripture, that every honeſt and unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced man may underſtand them; but however, as I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we govern our ſelves in theſe things by the received Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the catholick church of the firſt and pureſt Ages, and if this be not a ſafe Rule, we can be certain of nothing. And what the catholick Faith was, we learn from thoſe ſhort ſummaries of Faith, which were univerſally owned by all catholick churches. For what we now call the Apoſtles creed, was very anciently receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all churches, with ſome little variety indeed of Words and Phraſe, but without any difference of ſenſe; and the catholick Faith was not only preſerved in ſuch ſhort Summaries and creeds, which were as liable to be perverted by Hereticks, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, but was more largely explained in the Writings of the ancient Fathers; and though this will not enable us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every Phraſe and Expreſſion of Scripture, but we muſt uſe other means to do that, as Skill in the Original Languages, a knowledge of ancient cuſtoms, and ancient Diſputes, to which the Apoſtles frequently aflude, a conſideration of the Scope and Deſign of the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the catholick Faith received and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98824:27"/> owned by the Primitive Church, is ſo far a Rule, as, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to Expound Scripture to a true catholick ſenſe. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands the <hi>Romans,</hi> that thoſe who propheſie, ſhould Propheſie according to the proportion of Faith, <hi>Rom. 12. 6. Kat' analogian piſteos,</hi> according to the Analogie of Faith: That is, that in the interpreting the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament they ſhould expound them to a chriſtian ſenſe, according to thoſe Doctrines of the chriſtian Faith, which he had taught them; and this was a ſafe Rule for expounding the Old Teſtament, which contained the Types, and Figures, and Propheſies of the Goſpel-State. And thus in expounding the new Teſtament, now it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writting, we muſt Prohpeſie according to the Analogie of Faith, or as he commands <hi>Timothy</hi> in his Preaching, Hold faſt the form of ſound words, which thou haſt heard from me; <hi>2. Tim. 1. 13.</hi> It ſeems the Apoſtle had given him a form of ſound words, according to which he was to direct his Preaching; whither this refers to a ſhort ſummary of Faith, ſuch as our Creed is, <hi>I</hi> cannot ſay, though it is not improbable it may; but it is plain, we have a form of ſound words delivered to us by the Catholick Church, which contains the true Catholick Faith, and therefore ought to be ſo far a Rule to us in expounding Scripture, as never to contradict any thing which is contained in it, for that is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Faith of the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>And when one great Article of this Faith, concerning the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God-head of Chriſt the Son of God, was corrupted by <hi>Arius,</hi> a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> it gave an occaſion for a full Declaration of the ſenſe of the Catholick Church about it. And though the effects of that Controverſie were very fatal to the Church, yet it was very happy that it broke out in ſuch an Age, when it could be determined with greater certainty and greater Authority, then it could have been in any ſucceeding Age of the Church; by men, who were venerable for their Age, for their Wiſdom, for their Piety, for their undaunted Confeſſions under Heathen and Perſecuring Emperours, who knew what the ſenſe of the Catholick Church was, before this Controverſie broke out, and before Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Proſperity had, through eaſe and wantonneſs, corrupted the Faith; as well as the Manners of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for matters of External Order, Diſcipline. and Government, the Univerſall Practice of the Catholick Church is the beſt and ſafeſt Comment on theſe General Rules and Directions we have laid down in Scripture. There is no doubt at all, but the Apoſtles did appoint Governours, and Rules of Order and Diſcipline, in the Churches planted by them: what theſe were the Chriſtians of thoſe dayes ſaw with their eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the dayly practice
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98824:27"/> of the Church; and therefore the Apoſtles, in thoſe Epiſtles which they wrote to their ſeveral Churches, did not give them ſo punctual, and particular an account of thoſe matters, which they ſo well knew before, but, as occaſion: ſerved, make only ſome accidental mention of theſe things, and that in ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, as were well enough underſtood by them, who knew the practice of the Church in that Age, but it may be, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meerly by the force of the words, which may be capable of ſeveral Senſes, be ſo certainly and demonſtratively determined to any one ſenſe (by us, who did not ſee what was done in thoſe dayes) as to avoid all poſſible Cavils of contentious men.</p>
                  <p>This has occaſioned thoſe diſputes concerning Infant Baptiſm, the ſeveral Orders and Degrees of Church Governours, the Rites and ceremonies of Religious Worſhip, and the like. Thoſe who lived in thoſe dayes, and ſaw what the Apoſtles did in theſe matters, could not doubt of theſe things, thought it were not in expreſs words ſaid, that infants ſhould be baptized with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or that Biſhops are a Superiour Order to Presbyters, and Presbyters to Deacons, or that it is lawful for the Governours of the Church to inſtitute and appoint ſome ſignificant Rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for the more decent and orderly Adminiſtration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Offices. But becauſe there is not a preciſe and punctual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of theſe matters, in the Writings of the Apoſtles, which there was no need of then, when theſe things were obvious to their very Senſes, ſome perverſe and unreaſonable Diſputers, who obſtinately reject all other Evidence, will judge of theſe things juſt as they pleaſe themſelves, and alter their Opinions and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as often as they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>But now if there be any certain way to know, what the practice of the Apoſtles was in theſe caſes, this is the beſt comment we can poſſibly have on ſuch Texts, as are not ſufficiently plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs without it. Now me thinks any reaſonable man muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the beſt way to underſtand the Practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, is from the Practice of the Catholick Church in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, eſpecially while the memory of the Apoſtles was freſh, and the Church Governed by Apoſtolical Men; when we cannot reaſonably ſuſpect any Deviation from the Primitive Practice; and this is the Rule which the Church of <hi>England</hi> owns in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by which ſhe rejects and confutes both the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the wild pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Phanaticiſm.</p>
                  <p>So that we do in the moſt proper ſenſe own the Belief and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Church, to be the beſt means for Expounding Scripture. We do not leave every man to Expound Scripture
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98824:28"/> by a private Spirit, as our Adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us; we adhere to the ancient Catholick Church, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on one ſide, and the Phanaticks on the other, have forſaken: And though we reject the new invention of an infallible Judge, yet we are no Friends at all to Scepticiſm, but can give a more Rational account of our Faith, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can.</p>
                  <p>Had we no other way of underſtanding the ſenſe of Scripture, but by Propriety of the Language, and the Grammatical conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Words, and the ſcope and deſign of the Texts, their connexion and Dependence on what goes before, and what follows, and ſuch like means as we uſe for the underſtanding any other Books of humane compoſition; I doubt not, but honeſt and diligent Inquirers might diſcover the true meaning of Scripture, in all the great Articles of our Faith; but yet this alone is a more uncertain way, and lyable to the Abuſes of Hereticks and Impoſtors. The <hi>Socinians</hi> are a famous Example, what Wit and Criticiſm will do to pervert the plainſt Text; and ſome other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries are as plain a demonſtration, what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rk Dullneſs and Stupidity, and Enthuſiaſm will make with Scripture; but when we have the practice of the Catholick Church, and an ancient and venerable ſummary of the Chriſtian Faith, which has been the common Faith of Chriſtians in all Ages, to be our Rule in Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, though we may after all miſtake the ſenſe of ſome particular Texts, yet we cannot be guilty of any great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>This uſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> makes of the Catholick Church in Expounding Scripture, that ſhe Religiouſly maintains the ancient Catholick Faith, and will not ſuffer any man to Expound Scriptures in oppoſition to the ancient Faith and Practice of the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>But though the Belief and Practice of the Catholick Church be the beſt means of underſtanding the true ſenſe of Scripture, yet we cannot affirm this of any particular Church, or of the Church of any particular Age, excepting the Apoſtolick Age, or thoſe Ages which immediately ſucceeded the Apoſtles. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be no good Expoſitor of Scripture, for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though ſhe uſurp the name of the Catholick Church as preſuming her ſelf to be the Head and Fountain of catholick Unity, yet ſhe is but a part of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>France</hi> aind <hi>Holland</hi> are; and has no more right to impoſe her Expoſitions of Scripture upon other Churches, then they have to impoſe upon her. If there happen any controverſie between them, it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98824:28"/> is not the Authority of either Church can decide it, but this muſt be done by an appeal to Scripture, and the ſenſe of the Catholick Church, in the firſt and pureſt Ages of it.</p>
                  <p>For when we ſay, that the belief and Practice of the Catholick Church is the beſt means to find out the true ſenſe of Scripture, we do not mean that the Church is the Soveraign and abſolute Judge of the ſenſe of Scripture, but the meaning is, that thoſe Churches, which were founded by the Apoſtles, and received the Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from them, and were afterwards, ſor ſome Ages, governed by Apoſtolical men, or thoſe who were taught by them, and convers'd with them, are the beſt Witneſſes what the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles was, and therefore as far as we can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, what the Faith of theſe Primitive Churches was, they are the beſt Guides for the Expounding Scripture.</p>
                  <p>So that the Authority of the Church in Expounding Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Authority of Witneſſes, it can reach no farther then thoſe Ages, which may reaſonably be preſumed to be Authentick and credible Witneſſes of the Doctrines of the Apoſtles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we extend it to the four firſt general councils; it is as far as we can do it with any pretence of Reaſon; and thus far the Church of <hi>England</hi> owns the Authority of the Church, and commands her Miniſters to Expound the Scriptures according to the Catholick Faith. owned and profeſſ'd in thoſe days; but as for the later Ages of the church, which were removed too far from the Apoſtles dayes, to be Witneſſes of their Doctrine, they have no more Authority in this matter, then we have at this day, nor has one church any more Authority then another.</p>
                  <p>3. And therefore, if by the church being the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe and meaning of the Holy Scriptures be underſtood the Judgment and Sentence, and Decree of the church, that we muſt ſeek no farther for the reaſon of our Faith, then the infallible Authority of the church, in Expounding Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this alſo is abſolutely falſe and abſurd.</p>
                  <p>This is more then Chriſt and his Apoſtles aſſumed to themſelves, while they were on Earth; they were indeed infallible Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Scripture, but yet they never bore down their Hearers meerly with their Authority, but Expounded the Scriptures, and applied ancient Propheſies to their Events, and took the vail off of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Face, and ſhewed them the Goſpel ſtate concealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Types and Figures; they confirmed their Expoſitions of Scripture by the force of Reaſon, and appealed to the Judgments and conſciences of their Hearers, whither theſe things were not ſo; Chriſt commands the <hi>Jews</hi> nor meerly to take his own word, and to rely on his Authority for the truth of what he ſaid, but to ſtudy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98824:29"/> the Scriptures themſelves; and the <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended for this generous temper of mind, that they were more noble then thoſe of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> for they daily ſearch'd the Scriptures, to ſee whither the Doctrine the Apoſtles preach'd were to be found there or not? Now I think no Church can pretend to be more infallible then Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and therefore, certainly ought not to aſſume more to themſelves then they did; and if the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Church, will convince us of the truth of their Expoſitions of Scripture, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd their Hearers, that is by enlightning our Underſtandings, and convincing our Judgments by proper Arguments, we will gladly learn of them.</p>
                  <p>This courſe the Primitive Chriſtians took, as is evident in all the Writings of the ancient Fathers againſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> they argue from the Scriptures themſelves to prove what the ſenſe of Scripture i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; they appeal indeed ſometimes to the ſenſe of the Catholick Church, not as an infallible Judge of Scripture, but as the beſt Witneſſes of the Apoſtolical Doctrine: Thus <hi>Tertulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t when they reaſon about the ſenſe of Scripture, they never direct us to any infallible Judge, but uſe ſuch Arguments, as they think proper to convince Gain-ſayers.</p>
                  <p>Nay, this is the way, which was obſerved in all the Ancient Councils; the Biſhops of the church met together for common counſel and advice, and in matters of Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were ſubject to their Authority, they conſidered what was' moſt for the publick benefit of the church, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them by their Authority, not as infallible Judges, but as Supreme Governours of the church. In the diſputes of Faith, they reaſon from Scripture, and the ſenſe of the catholick church, not from their own Authority; and what upon a ſerious debate and inquiry they found to be moſt agreeable to the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Doctrine of the church of former Ages, that they determined, and decreed to be received in all churches, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith. That this is ſo, is evident from all the Hiſtories of the moſt Ancient, and celebrated councils, which any man may conſult, who pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>Now I would ask ſome few Queſtions about this matter. 1. Whither-theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> councils took a ſure and ſafe way to find out Truth? If they did not, what reaſon have we to believe that they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined right? If they did, then we may uſe the ſame way, which they did; for that which is a good way in one Age, is ſo in another, and then there is no neceſſity of an Infallible Judge, to find out the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98824:29"/> becauſe we have other certain wayes of doing this; the ſame which all the ancient Councils obſerved.</p>
                  <p>2. I would know, whither it be not ſufficient for every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to receive the Decrees and Determinations of theſe councils, upon the ſame Reaſon and Authority which moved the Fathers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in council to make theſe Decrees? Whither, for inſtance, we muſt not believe the Eternal God-head of Chriſt, and that he is of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

If we muſt, then Scripture, and the ſenſe of the catholick church, not the Authority of a general council, or any Infallible Judge, is the Reaſon of our Faith: For the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, who were the firſt that met in a General council, could not believe this, upon the Authority of any other General council much leſs upon their own Authority; unleſs we will ſay, that they firſt Decreed this, then believed it, becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Decreed it. If Scripture, and the ſenſe of the Catholick Church, antecedently to the determinations of a General council, or any other pretended Infallible Judge, be not a ſufficient foundation for our Faith, then the whole chriſtian World, before the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was the firſt general council, had no ſufficient Foundation for their Faith, for there was no particular Biſhop, or church in thoſe dayes, which pretended to be the Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scriptures. We Proteſtants have the ſame way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures, have the ſame Reaſon and Foundation of our Faith, which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers themſelves had, or which any chriſtan could have, before there was any general council, and if the church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not think this enough, we cannot help that, we are abundantly ſatisfied with it.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of a general council in thoſe dayes, was deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſacred and venerable, not as an infallible Judge, which they never pretended to, but as the moſt certain means they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have to underſtand, what was, and in all Ages had been the received Doctrine of the catholick church. They met together not to make new Articles of Faith, which no council in the World ever had any Authority to do, but to declare what was the truly ancient and. Apoſtolick Faith; and to put it into ſuch words, as might plainly expreſs the catholick ſenſe, and meet with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of that Age.</p>
                  <p>For this end Grave and Reverend Biſhops aſſembled from all parts of the chriſtian World, not meerly to give their private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of things, but to Declare what was the received Doctrine o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this is the true Authority of thoſe ancient councils, that they were moſt likely to underſtand the true ſenſe of Scripture, and of the Catholick Church. This is the Proteſtant Reſolution of Faith, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had no other way, nor pretended to any other.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, as much as ſhe talks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, makes very little uſe of it. She has never given us an infallible comment on Scripture, but ſuffers her Doctors to write as fallible comments, and in many things as contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as any Proteſtant Divines do: And I cannot imagine what good Infallibility does, if an infallible Church has no better means of underſtanding Scripture, then the comments of fallible men; that is, no better means then every fallible Church has; for no man can underſtand the Scripture ever the better for the Churches being infallible, unleſs this infallible Church improve this glorious Talent of Infallibility in Expounding Scripture; which ſhe has not done to this day, and I believe never will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Indeed it is apparent, that infallibility, as it is pretended to by the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be of no uſe, either in the Refolution of Faith, or in confuting Hereticks, who deny this Infallibility, and then I cannot imagine what it is good for, but to multiply Diſputes, inſtead of ending them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Reſolution of Faith; ſuppoſe I ask a Papiſt; why he believes ſuch Articles, as the Divinity of Chriſt, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, to be contained in Scripture? If he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as he muſt do, Becauſe he is taught ſo by the church, which is infallible; my next Queſtion is, How he knows the Church to be infallible? If he ſays he learns this from Scripture; I ask him how he comes to underſtand the Scripture, and how he knows that this is the ſenſe of it? If he know this by the infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the church, then he runs round in a circle, and knows the Scripture by the church, and the church by the Scripture, as I obſerved before; if he can find out the Churches infallibility by the Scripture, without the help of an infallible Judge, then it ſeems the Scripture is, to be underſtood without the infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church; and if men can find out infallibility in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture without the Church, I am confident they may find out any thing elſe in Scripture as well, without the Churches infallibility: For there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> no Article of our creed ſo hard to be found there, as the Churches infallibility is. But however that be, after all this boaſt of infallibility, a Papiſt has no more infallible Foundation for his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98824:30"/> Faith, then a Proteſtant has, nor half ſo much. We believe the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, becauſe we find them plainly taught in Scripture, and univerſally received as the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Catholick church in the beſt and pureſt Ages of it: A Papiſt believes the Church to be Infallible, becauſe he thinks he finds it in Scripture, though the Catholick church for many Ages never found it there, and the greateſt part of the Chriſtian church to this day cannot find it there: Now if they will but allow, that a Proteſtant (though a poor fallible Creature) may reaſon about the ſenſe of Scripture, as well as a Papiſt, and that the Evidence of reaſon is the ſame to both, then we Proteſtants ſtand upon as firm ground as the Papiſts here; and are at leaſt as certain of all thoſe Doctrines of Faith, which we find in the Scripture, and are ready to prove by it, as they are of their Churches infallibility; but then we have an additional Security, that we Expound the Scriptures right, which they want, and that is the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Church, which confirms all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Faith, and Rules of Worſhip and Diſcipline, but gives not the leaſt intimation, that the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was thought infallible by them, and if the Primitive Church was ignorant of this, which is the beſt witneſs of Apoſtolical Tradition, it is moſt probable, that no ſuch thing is contained in Scripture, though ſome mercenary Flatterers of the Pope have endeavoured to perſwade the World, that they found it there.</p>
                  <p>So that we have a greater aſſurance of all the Articles of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from Scripture and Catholick Tradition, then a Papiſt can have of the Churches Infallibility, and yet he can have no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſurance of any other Doctrines of Religion, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves upon the Churches Infallibility, then he has of Infallibility it ſelf. So that in the laſt Reſolution of Faith, the Proteſtant has much the advantage of the Papiſt, for the Proteſtant reſolves his Faith into the Authority of the Scriptures, Expounded by the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Church, the Papiſt reſolves his into the Infallibility of the Church; which he finds out only by Expounding Scripture by a private Spirit, without the Authority of any church, but that whoſe Authority is under diſpute,</p>
                  <p>And as the Doctrine of Infallibility is of no uſe in the laſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Faith, ſo it is wholly uſeleſs in diſputing with ſuch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as we are, who deny Infallibility: for it is a vain thing to attempt to impoſe any abſurd, or groundleſs, and uncatholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines upon us, by the Churches infallible Authority, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no ſuch infallible Judge; but are reſolved to truſt our own Eyes, and to adhere to Scripture and the Catholick Faith of the Primitive Church in theſe matters.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98824:31"/> And therefore the great Advocats for the Church of Rome are forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take the ſame courſe in confuting Hereſies, as they call them, that we do: They alledge the Authority of Scripture, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Fathers and Councils, to juſtifie their Innovations, and here we willingl joyn iſſue with them, and are ready to prove, that Scripture and all true Antiquity is on our ſide; and this has been often and unanſwerably proved by the learned Patrons of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome very material things to be obſerved from hence, for our preſent purpoſe. For either they think this a good way to prove what they intend, and to convince Gain-ſayers the Authority of Scripture, and Primitive Antiquity, or they do not. If they do not think this a good way, to what purpoſe are there ſo many Volumes of Controverſie written?

                  <p>If the Authority of the Primitive Church, and firſt Chriſtian Writers, be conſiderable, (as they acknowledge it is, by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to them) then, at leaſt, the preſent Pope or Church, is not the ſole infallible Judge of controverſies; unleſs they will ſay, that we muſt not Judge of the Doctrine or Practice of the Primitive Church, by ancient records, (and then <hi>Baronius</hi> his Annals are worth nothing) but by the Judgement and Practice of the preſent Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſum is this, There is great reaſon to ſuſpect that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, does not believe her own Infallibility, no more than we Proteſtants do; for if ſhe does, ſhe ought not to ſuffer her Doctors to diſpute with Hereticks, from any other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, but her own Authority; when they vie Reaſons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98824:31"/> appeal from the infallibility of the preſent church, to every mans private Reaſon and Judgment, as much as any Proteſtant does: and if the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith may be eſtabliſh'd by Scripture and Antiquity, without an infallible Judge, as they ſuppoſe they may be, by their frequent attempts to do it; this plainly overthrows the neceſſity of an infallible Judge. In a word, not to take notice now, how weak and groundleſs this pretence of Infallibility is, it is evident, that it is a very uſeleſs Doctrine; for thoſe who believe the churches Infallibility, have no greater aſſurance of their Faith, then we have, who do not believe it; and thoſe who do not believe the churches Infallibility, can never be confuted by it. So that it can neither eſtabliſh any mans Faith, nor confute any Hereſies; that is, it is of no uſe at all.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> Reverences the Authority of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, as the beſt witneſs of the Apoſtolical Faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but yet reſolves her Faith at laſt into the Authority of the Scriptures. She receives nothing for an Article of Faith, which ſhe does not find plainly enough taught in Scripture, but it is a great confirmation of her interpretation of Scripture, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive church owned the ſame Doctrines, which ſhe does; and ſhe looks upon it as a juſt prejudice againſt any Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Scripture, if they contradict the common Faith of the firſt Chriſtians; and therefore when the words of Scripture are fairly capable of different ſenſes, ſhe chooſes that ſenſe which is moſt agreeable with the Catholick Faith, and practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church; but ſhould any Doctrines be impoſed upon her, as Articles of Faith, which are no where to be found in Scripture, or which are plainly contrary to it, (as the new <hi>Trent</hi> Creed is) whatever pretence there be for the Antiquity of ſuch Doctrines, ſhe utterly rejects them; ſhe will not put out her Eyes to follow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guide; and thanks be to God, ſhe needs not reject any truly Catholick Doctrine in this way. We ſtill retain the Faith of the Primitive Church, and are greatly confirmed in it, from that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable conſent there is between the Scriptures, as Expounded by us, and that Faith which was anciently owned and received by all Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſhewn in what ſenſe the Church is the Interpreter of Scripture: I proceed now to the Second thing contained in this Paper, That this Church muſt be known to be the true Church, by its continual viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt till our dayes. Now theſe few words contain a great many, and very great miſtakes. The ſubject of the inquiry is, how we may find out ſuch a Church, whoſe word we may ſafely take for the true ſenſe and meaning of Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98824:32"/>
                  <p>Now, 1. The Author of this Paper, whither, ignorantly, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, I know not, alters the ſtate of the Queſtion, and in ſtead of a Church, which is an unerring and Infallible Interpreter of Scripture, which would be very well worth finding, he tells us how we may know a true Church; now I take a true Church, and and an infallible Interpreter of Scripture, to be very different things. A Church may be guilty of Schiſm and Hereſie, and yet may be a true Church, though not a ſound, Orthodox, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; for a true Church is ſuch a Church, as has all things neceſſary, and eſſential to the Beeing and Conſtitution of a Church; this a Church may have, and ſuperadd other things, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Chriſtian Faith, and very dangerous and fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; as we believe, and are able to prove the Church of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if a true Church may corrupt the Chriſtian Faith, we have no reaſon to rely on the Authority of every true Church, for the true ſenſe and meaning of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us ſuppoſe, that by a true Church, he means an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Church, whoſe Authority we may ſafely rely on in Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scriptures; this Church, he ſayes, is to be known by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt, till our dayes: Now if this viſible uninterrupted Succeſſion be the mark of ſuch a true Church, as is an infallible Interpreter of Scripture, then, 1. The <hi>Greek</hi> Church is an infallible Interpreter of Scripture; for ſhe has as viſible unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted a Succeſſion, from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this day, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has; and ſo we have two infallible Churches (not to inſtance in any more at preſent, who have as good a Succeſſion as either of them) which are directly oppoſite to each other; and what ſhall we do in this Caſe? Muſt we believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, or muſt we diſ-believe infallible Churches?</p>
                  <p>3. If a viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles makes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y church an infallible Interpreter of Scripture, then all the churches, which were planted by the Apoſtles, were infallible. All the churches which were planted by the Apoſtles, have an equally viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt; thoſe churches which were planted by the Apoſtles, may be preſumed as infallible while the Apoſtles were preſent with them, as they were afterwards; and thoſe churches which ſucceeded theſe Apoſtolical churches, at the diſtance of an Age or two, may be ſuppoſed as infallible as any church of this Age is; for if a viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt makes a church infallible, why ſhould not a Succeſſion of a hundred, or two hundred years make them as infallible as a Succeſſion of ſixteen
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98824:32"/> hundred years, unleſs they think that Infallibility increaſes with the Age of the Church, which I could wiſh true, but we ſee very little ſign of it. Now according to theſe Principles all the churches which were planted by the Apoſtles, and have a continual viſible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from Apoſtolical Churches, through all Ages ſince the time of the Apoſtles, muſt be infallible; for if a continual viſible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion confers Infallibility, and is the mark whereby we muſt know it, then every Church, which ever had, or has to this day this viſible Succeſſion, muſt have Infallibility alſo, which, it ſeems, is entailed on Succeſſion. And thus we have found out a World of infallibility, and it is wonderful, how any Apoſtolical Church came to be over-run with ſo many Errors and Hereſies, and to grow ſo corrupt and degenerate, as to provoke GOD to root them up; if every Apoſtolical Church was infallible, I cannot imagine how whole Churches, which viſibly ſucceeded the Apoſtles, ſhould be infected with Hereſie; for if Infallibility it ſelf will not ſecure a Church from Hereſie, the LORD have mercy upon us.</p>
                  <p>3. This mark he gives how to find out ſuch a true Church at is an infallible Interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as the moſt Authentick Witneſs of the Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice, then we cannot find out this church by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Succeſſion to this day, but by examining the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Primitive Church, where we ſhall find what the Faith and Practice of the Church in thoſe dayes was, which is the ſafeſt Rule to guide us in the Expoſition of Scripture. Though there were no Church in the World at this day, which could prove a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, yet while we have the Scriptures, and the Records of the Primitive church we have very ſufficient means for the underſtanding the true meaning of Scripture: So that of whatever uſe this talk of a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al viſible Succeſſion may be in other caſes, it is wholly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this. A church which cannot prove ſuch a continual viſible Succeſſion; which was not founded by any Apoſtle, or Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men, or has loſt the Memory or Records of its firſt Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may yet have very certain means of knowing the true ſenſe of Scripture, from the Scripture it ſelf, and the Doctrine and Practice of Apoſtolical and Primitive Churches, and a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98824:33"/> Church which has the moſt viſible uninterrupted Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, may be ſo far from being an infallible Interpreter of Scripture, that ſhe may be very corrupt and erroneous her ſelf, if ſhe forſake the Apoſtolical Tradition, contained in the Writings, of the new Teſtament, and Expounded by the Catholick Faith and Practice of the firſt Churches; as we know the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has done, which is ſo far from being an infallible Church, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her to be the moſt corrupt Church in the World.</p>
                  <p>And thus I think we are prepared to venture upon the laſt Clauſe of this Paper, wherein the whole force of the Argument, ſuch as it is, is turned upon the poor Proteſtant Churches. But I doubt (ſayes the Author of this Paper) whither or no the Proteſtant Church can make out this continual viſible Succeſſion, and deſire to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſting of which Argument lies in this, that we Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants have no certain way of knowing the true ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nſe and meaning of Scripture, becauſe we cannot prove the continual viſible Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Church, from Chriſt unto this day; and therefore we ought to go over to the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has this viſible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and receive all her Dictates as infallible Oracles. But, for Anſwer to this, conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſuppoſe the Proteſtant Church could not make out ſuch a continual viſible Succeſſion, yet we may underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures very well without it, and need not go to the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture for us, as I have already ſhewn at large. Had he proved that we had been no church, for want of a viſible Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of church Officers, or that our Religion were a Novelty, which was never heard of it in the world before <hi>Luther,</hi> this had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to the purpoſe; but to pretend that we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures, for want of a viſible Succeſſion, is ſuch a looſe and inconſequent way of reaſoning, as a poor fallible Proteſtant would be aſhamed of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But pray, why can't the Proteſtant Church of England prove her continual viſible Succeſſion from Chriſt till this day, as well as the church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Here was a Chriſtian Church planted in this Nation, as very good Hiſtorians ſay, as early as at <hi>Rome,</hi> and it has continued here ever ſince, to this day: when <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk came over to <hi>England,</hi> he found here a company of reſolute Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Biſhops and Monks, who would not ſubmit to the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral Changes and Alterations, have continued to this day, with a viſible Succeſſion of Chriſtian Biſhops, and what better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion can <hi>Rome</hi> ſhew than this?</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick will diſown the Succeſſion of the church of <hi>England,</hi> till the Reformation, and I pray, how came
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98824:33"/> we to loſe our Succeſſion then? Did the Reformation of thoſe Abuſes and Corruptions, which had crept into the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church us? Juſt as much as a man ceaſes to be the ſame man, when he is cured of ſome mortal Diſeaſe: Did not the Church of <hi>England</hi> conſiſt of the ſame Perſons, before the Reformation and after? A great many indeed diſowned the Reformation; but were not all thoſe Perſons who were ſo active and zealous in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, formerly of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion? And did they loſe their Succeſſion too, when they became Reformers? When a Church conſiſts of the ſame Biſhops, Prieſts, and People, which ſhe had before, though ſhe have not all the ſame that ſhe had; when ſhe retains the ſame ancient Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith, which ſhe did before, only renounces ſome Errors and Innovations, which ſhe owned before, how does this forfeit her Succeſſion? The Church of <hi>England</hi> is the very ſame Church now, ſince the Reformation, which ſhe was before, and therefore has the very ſame Succeſſion, though not the ſame Errors, to this day, that ever ſhe had; and that, I think, is as good a Succeſſion as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has.</p>
                  <p>There are but two things to be conſidered in the caſe of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Either a Succeſſion of Church Officers, or a Succeſſion of the Faith and Doctrines of the Church.</p>

As for a Succeſſion of Church Officers, we have the ſame that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has, Thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops who embraced the Reformation, received their Orders in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore they had as good Orders, as any are in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and theſe were the Perſons, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated other Biſhops, and ſo in Succeſſion to this day. For as for the ſtory of the Nags-head Ordination, that is ſo tranſparent a Forgery, invented many years after to Reproach the Reformation that I preſume no ſober Roman Catholick will inſiſt on it.</p>
                  <p>But we are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and this forfeits our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and our Succeſſion together. But, 1. This charge ought firſt to be proved againſt us, that we are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks we deny and abhor both the name and thing, and if we be not Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, as we are ſure we are not, and as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can never prove us to be, then according to their own Confeſſion, our Orders muſt be good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. However be we Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, or what ever they pleaſe to call us, how does this deſtroy our Orders and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion? The Catholick Church would not allow in former Ages, that Hereſie or Schiſm deſtroyed the validity of Orders. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> diſputes againſt this at large, in his Book
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98824:34"/> 
                     <hi>Contra Luciferianos.</hi> And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> allows the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> Biſhops to have valid Orders, though they were Schiſmaticks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Sacraments adminſtred by them were valid. And indeed, if Hereſie will deſtroy Orders and Succeſſion, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be as much to ſeek for their Orders and Succeſſion, as we are, which, by their own Confeſſion, have had ſeveral Heretical Popes, and no body knows how many Biſhops Ordained by them.</p>
                  <p>2. As for Succeſſion of Doctrine, which is as conſiderable to the full, as Succeſſion of Orders, the great Articles of our Faith are not only plainly contained in Scripture, but have been delivered down to us, through all ages of the Church by an uninterrupted Succeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf, in her greateſt Degeneracy, did own all that we do in pure matters of Faith: When we reformed the Church we did not make a new Religion, but only ſeparated the old Faith from new and corrupt Additions; and therefore the quarrel of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with us. is not that we believe any thing which they do not believe, but that we do not believe all that they would have us.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is truly Primitive and Catholick, taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, owned by the Primitive Church, and excepting the Diſpute between the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church, about the <hi>Filioque,</hi> or the Holy Spirits proceeding from the Father and the Son, received by all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick churches to this day; which is as compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Succeſſion, as any Doctrine can have; therefore when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> asks us, Where was our Religion before <hi>Luther?</hi> we tell them it was all the World over, all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick churches believed what we do, though we do not believe all that they do, they themſelves did, and do to this Day own our creeds, and Articles of Faith, excepting ſuch of them as are directly oppoſed to their Innovations.</p>
                  <p>So that we are on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ure Foundation, our Faith has been received in the catholick church in all Ages. But now the church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot ſhew ſuch a Succeſſion for her new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Articles of Faith, which were unknown to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive church for many Ages, which were rejected by many flouriſhing churches, ſince the firſt appearance of them, which never had a quiet poſſeſſion in her own communion, and were never formed into Articles of Faith, till the packt conventicle of <hi>Trent.</hi>

Yet notwithſtanding all this, by the Malice and Subtility of the Devil, the Deſigns and Paſſions of Men, the Ignorance and Negligence of ſome, the Cunning and Induſtry of others, this plain and ſimple Religion began by degrees to be corrupted by the mixtures of Philoſophy and niceneſs, by the Rules of Stat Craft and Policy, by idle Traditions, and Inventions; by the Melancholy of ſome, and the gayety of others; and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Face of it was ſo ſtrangely changed that it ſeem'd another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

And therefore they ſay, we ought to look from whence we are faln, to repent of our Hereſie, and returne to our firſt Love, and not ſtick ſo cloſe to our Religion, the new invention of ſo ill a Man. That we may therefore keep thoſe firme that are members of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bring thoſe back that have revolted from us into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Communion, we have endeavour'd to give a ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this their Queſtion, <hi>Where was your Religion before the times of Luther?</hi> Not to trouble our ſelves with ſuch Legends as theſe, and Uncharitableneſs along with them, the Anſwer is thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Telling them plainly where our Religion was before <hi>Luthers</hi> time.</p>

                  <p>1. The plain Anſwer to the Queſtion is this: That our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was long before the times of <hi>Luther,</hi> and believed and ſetled in many Kingdoms and Nations of the World, and hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Novelty nor Singularity in it. 'Tis an old Religion, I am ſure 'tis of Age and can ſpeak for it ſelf. It hath laſted now theſe 1600 years and more, founded at firſt by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, handed down to us through many Sufferings and Perſecutions, and here it is preſerved. It contracted indeed in the coming down a great deal of ruſt by the Falſeneſs and Careleſneſs of its keepers, particularly by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſcowr'd off the ruſt, and kept the mettal; that's the Romiſh Religon, this is the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They added Falſe Doctrines to the Chriſtian Faith, we left the one and kept to the other; this is Ancient, thoſe are New. Our Religion is the ſame with that of the Early Chriſtians, Martyrs, and Confeſſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the firſt 300 years, and defended by all Councils truely General; Our Religion in thoſe firſt Ages was in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Antioch</hi> where the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Antiquity muſt evidence the Truth of our Religion, we are ſafe and ſecure that we have right on our ſide. And this will appear if we conſider theſe following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Conformity our Religion carries to that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Let any impartial eye compare them both together, and he will find the features and complexion, the whole body of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the ſame in both. Whatever they delivered out at firſt, as Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to Salvation, whatever they inſtituted as parts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Diſcipline, and Order, we ſtill faithfully retain in our Church, and if any Truth of moment hitherto by Fraud or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be concealed from her, ſhe is ready to receive it, when ever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98824:37"/> it is made plain, not having ſtopt up the way of Truth by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Infallibility or want of Modeſty to confeſs an error. She hath the ſame ſenſe of the Nature, Offices, the Deſign and whole Undertakings of Chriſt, that the truly Ancient Church had; She receives the Creed and Bible, and any Traditions that can be made out to be truly Divine, in the ſame meaning and underſtanding that Chriſt and his Apoſtles gave to the firſt Chriſtians, and they to us. What their thoughts of Saints and holy Souls departed were, ours are, thoughts of reſpect, remembrance and imitation, not divine Worſhip. Chriſt inſtituted proper Figures, and Symbols of Bread &amp; Wine, to repreſent and confirm, to conveigh and commemorate his bloudy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Benefits to Mankind; in this ſenſe She preſerves the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſacred, and doth not really Sacrifice or Crucifie the LORD of Life again. Chriſt commanded good works under the penalty of eternal Damnation, She doth the ſame, and in our Maſters language bids the doers of them call themſelves unprofitable Servants, beating down Pride and Merit. Chriſt and his Apoſtles told the World what depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls muſt expect; Her ſenſe is the ſame, that there are no ſecond Ventures and Trials to be made, neither can a kind Friend with a good Eſtate, left for Maſſes or Monks, compound for a Life ill ſpent. Run through the whole conſtitution of our Church in Articles of Faith, and Rules of Manners, you may trace them to Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, and all other parts of her Government and Order are truly Primitive. And it muſt needs be ſo, if She ſincerely follo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s her rule of Faith, the holy Scriptures, ſo Ancient, ſo Divine, and whatever is declared there eſſential to Salvation She brings into her Creed, and reſolves to keep it, like a mighty Treaſure, faithfully unto death. And indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confeſſes, that what we do retain is ancient and Apoſtolical; but pretends that we are defective in many things, and want ſome neceſſaries which they have, to make an entire Faith. But we challenge them to prove that thoſe opinions wherein we differ from them were delivered by Chriſt or any men divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired in thoſe times. And they ſeem to acknowledge we do not, and therefore to make up the matter, pretend a Divine Authority in the Church, to caſt new Articles, and Truths <hi>fere de fide,</hi> almoſt fit for a Creed, and ſome others of them confeſs that ſome of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Image-Worſhip and others were not maintain'd in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity for fear of coming too near the Heathens Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and out of other Prudential conſiderations, ſo that whoſoever doth compare the Doctrine of our Church, with that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, muſt needs conclude that our Religion is Ancient Chriſtianity, and that the charge of Novelty is groundleſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Nature of Reformation, which was not to found a New Church but correct an old one, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98824:37"/> that Pearl of great price, was hid with traſh and <note place="margin">Mat, 13. 3.</note> filth, that the Romiſh Church had heap'd upon it, our Reformers removed only what loaded and obſcur'd it, and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to its firſt Beauty and Luſtre. Such a Reformation indeed is later then their errors, and it muſt needs be ſo, it naturally ſuppoſing them before, otherwiſe 'tis not Reformation but a deſtructive change; but Primitive Chriſtianity which is our Religion was long before the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormer Health. When Chriſt reformed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion from the falſe ſenſes and gloſſes that the Scribes and Phariſees had put upon it, and grafted Chriſtianity upon the old ſtock, will the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> call this a New Religion, or rather an old one well amended and improved by Divine Authority, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth allow this for Truth, and ſaith that Chriſtianity was rather a new State and Condition then a new church, and he that can call our Religion New, becauſe 'tis mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made now, what it was about 1600 years ago, may affirm that Chriſt built a new Temple when he Whipt the buyers and ſellers out of the old. And that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> built a <note place="margin">2 Chron. 305</note> New Sanctuary, and Inſtituted a New Paſſover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cleanſ'd the one and reſtor'd the other to its firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; our Reformation did no more, it only ſcal'd off the Leproſie that ſtuck to the Body of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, it only pair'd off thoſe Additions that Intereſt or Superſtition, Niceneſs or Foppery, had glew'd to it; what after remain'd, was our Religion, the ſame that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught the world at firſt. And if they can ſhew that any thing hath been added ſince, pernicious to the Nature of the True and Old Religion, our church is ready to remove it, or that any thing is wanting that is neceſſary to its complement and perfection, ſhe is ready to entertain it with the ſame ſpirit of meekneſs and Wiſdom, and Regard to the Goſpel, that ſhe uſed in the Reformation; but hitherto upon good grounds and ſtrict inquiry She is fully ſatisfied that Her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is abſolute and compleat Chriſtianity.</p>

Some of theſe ſadly bewailed the degenerate ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> church; others petitioned for, and adviſed not only the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the abuſes of good Doctrines and innocent Inſtitutions, but the Reformation of groſs Errours and ſcandalous Additions to the chriſtian Faith, and others in great Authority promiſed an amendement and to reduce the whole frame of chriſtianity to its Primitive ſenſe &amp; Model.

And the intrigues of <hi>Trent</hi> may be acted once more, and as many new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith as Titular Biſhops, by the ſame Spirit moving in the ſame manner: were not the firſt and early Chriſtians ſound Members of Chriſts Body though they never thought of ſuch wild Opinions as theſe, and publiſh'd truths directly contrary to them? And could <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe them to have known theſe Innovations, out of Zeal and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to their truſt, would have deteſted and abhor'd them. Was Chriſt negligent in the diſcharge of his mighty Office, and his Apoſtles defective in their Duties and Miniſtry, not to acquaint the firſt Chriſtians with theſe great truths, and were they reveal'd in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> Council only to us upon whom the ends of the world are come. Theſe Primitive Diſciples of Chriſt thought <hi>themſelves ſecure of Heaven by this ſhort</hi> Creed, <hi>that Jeſus was the Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> And the contrary was the character of the Man of Sin, that denied that <hi>Jeſus was come in the Fleſh,</hi> that he was the God incarnate and the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and were ſcandalized at his meanneſs and obſcurity. S. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Jaylor, that certainly</hi> he would be ſaved if he believed that <hi>Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi> all other Fundamentals of Chriſtianity one way or other being neceſſarily included in that belief: And thought that he made <hi>ſincere and ſound Diſciples, if they</hi> believed what he preach'd <hi>only Jeſus and the Reſurrection,</hi> in their full compaſs and latitude. Though we believe all this in a more expreſs and explicite ſence, all that is contain'd in Scripture, in the Apoſtles Creed, or the two other Creeds drawn up by the Church to explain the Chriſtian Religion in ſome Articles, and to oppoſe the Doctrines of Hereticks, yet the firſt Chriſtians ſhall be ſaved and we ſhall be damned; they ſhall be the Elect and the Church of GOD, we muſt be Reprobates and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan. Or let <hi>Rome</hi> ſhew her wonted Charity, and ſay ſhe doubts alſo of their Salvation. Or did Chriſt connive at that time of Ignorance, or had he as a Lawgiver forgot to declare ſome part of the Will and Pleaſure of GOD, and upon better remembrance after ſo many hundred years, ſuggeſted it to his careful Vicar? Or did Chriſt, knowing their Nature and Circumſtances of it, that they could not bear them at that time, therefore delay the diſcovery ſo long? Or did theſe new Articles lie hid ſo long conceal'd by his Apoſtles, or buried by ſome lewd Hereticks in the rubbiſh of thoſe Churches they pull'd down, but afterwards found, (as they ſay the Croſs was) and now
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98824:40"/> ſtored to light? Or are theſe new Articles ſome way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ancient Creeds which we believe, and by eaſie and natural conſequences deduced from them. Some ſuch fine reaſons as theſe muſt be pretended, otherwiſe we can ſafely conclude that our Church is truely ancient and Apoſtolical, though ſhe diſowns the late inventions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhop and is known to be the Spouſe of Chriſt by her firſt features and complexion, though ſhe hath caſt off the new <hi>Italian</hi> dreſs. For, was the Chriſtian Church the Houſe of GOD, irregular in its building, wanting of Beams and Pillars, the Eſſentials of Religion, till <hi>Romes</hi> curious and careful Builder caſt it into a new Model and compleated it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Queſtion ſuppoſeth that the Chriſtian Church ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be viſible, which is not ſo ſtrictly true.

This Queſtion ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot err, but that it remained pure and undefiled, as it came from the hands of Chriſt, through the many Centuries of years, till it came to the times of <hi>Luther,</hi> and from thence ſhall ſo continue till the Worlds end, and therefore we made a falſe charge againſt them of corruptions in their Religion, to excuſe our Innovation. But we have reaſon to conclude She hath foully err'd from the Faith, and that more fatally and obſtinately, becauſe She pretends She cannot err. For upon what grounds doth She found Her Infallibility? Upon the Scriptures? They are onely ſo many dead Letters, till the breadth of the Church doth give them life, and they are then to do the Church a good turn and give her Infallibility, which is ſuch a Circle, as makes mens Brains ſo giddy turning round in it, that they ſcarce know what, he Scriptures, and what the Church do mean: the places of

And all the firſt Ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and undoubted Tradition never in the leaſt imagined ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility as now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> dreams of. They are at War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves where this Infallibility is lodg'd, either in the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or in a General Council alons, or in both together, the Pope ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in perſon there, or by his Legates, or in the council confirmed by the Pope; till they agree among themſelves and prove it better, we ſay 'tis no where plac'd but in the Scriptures, and they do not prove any other perſon or perſons upon Earth to be infallible in their determinations. To ſay ſuch an infallible Judge of Controverſies to guide the Church, is abſolutely neceſſary; and therefore Divine Providence hath plac'd him ſome where or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and who but the Pope can be the man? is only to preſcribe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods unto GOD, and teach him how to govern his Church, and not be thankful for the good old wayes of Salvation and Peace (Scriptures, an honeſt Judgment with Divine aſſiſtance and humane means) he hath chalkt out for us, but contrive ſome new ones of their own. Such infallibility muſt be of no uſe to the Church of GOD, for upon the <hi>Romiſh</hi> principles, it cannot be known, for the Pope before he be Infallible muſt be Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Sacrament of Order, according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> receives its validity from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Prieſt, that when he ordained him Biſhop, he did what the Church intended, and who can tell upon theſe grounds, what this ſuppoſed Prieſt was, who gave this Order, or dyve into his thoughts and intentions, which their Caſuiſts confeſs may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be very perverſe.

But why need we labour to diſprove the Popes Infallibility, when themſelves put their ſhoulders to it, and do the work for us, in diſputing among themſelves, whither the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Heretick may be depoſed, by which Queſtion they confeſs that he may fall into hereſie; which is errour of the higheſt nature, carrying wilfulneſs and obſtinacy with it.

If it be true in this caſe, 'tis ſo in all others, and then what a ſhelter have they provided for all Hereſies, if they chance to live long, to be ſafe and ſecure in, and eſcape correction.

And ſo Errours once ſuperinduced upon the Truth, will become by Age Truth it ſelf, and are never to be mended for fear of this pert Queſtion, and charge of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And it's plain that new and old are but uncertain Characters to judge of Truth and Falſhood by, there being ſometimes a new Truth that is lately diſcovered to be ſo, but really old, and an old errour kept up a long time by force or art, and walking in the garb of Truth, but truly new, having come in after the Truth it vies with: Time like a River many times bringing down Straw and Traſh, &amp; leaving weightier things behind, which when they come to be retriev'd are called new Faſhions and Inventions.

And the Apoſtles did not ſo much care to tell the punctual time to the Diſciples when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould diſcover himſelf, as to make them ſtand upon their guard to defend that Faith which he would invade, where and whenſoever he ſhould come, or whoſoever he was.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The difficuity of knowing the preciſe and punctual times when Errours firſt began. In many ſorts of Changes or Innovations, 'tis hard to know the nice time of their beginning, but ſome latitude of Judging is allow'd, and why not in things eſpecially relating to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Are there not wild Opinions left upon Record among the Pagan Writers, whoſe Authors are either unknown, or which are faſely fathered upon others, and as hard to be known as the head of <hi>Nile.</hi> Can the niceſt <hi>Romaniſt</hi> tell us what <hi>Rabbi;</hi> and in what place and age firſt ſuperinduc'd the ſeveral falſe Gloſſes and Senſes to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet our Saviour (though he knew <hi>them well) thought it ſufficient</hi> to tell them, that in the beginning <hi>it was not ſo,</hi> and by comparing the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Religion, it plainly appears they were new additions to the good old way And how many Errours ſprung up in times of Chriſtianity, of whoſe Original and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances both the Romaniſts and our ſelves are yet uncertain. And how many things of this nature more near our own times are we puzled about, and the difficulty of knowing them ariſeth principally from this twofold account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſubtilty of the contrivers of Errours: Which many times are the cunning and the wiſe in their Generation, which the neceſſity of their cauſe requires; Truth being ſtrong, and Errour nuturally weak, and that ſlie deceiving Spirits lends it his utmoſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to ſerve the deſign. Such men know how to diſguiſe new Falſhoods in the old habits of Truth, to make them look ancient and venerable; they feel and know the temper of the age, and fit their Opinions to the intereſt and pleaſure of it.

The Roman Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well cut out in its different Doctrines, to hit mens Vices and Paſſions, Gaiety or Melancholy, Enthuſiaſm or Fury, Power or Deſign, it's no wonder, it did prevail in a ſly and ſilent <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, intereſt having put out</hi> their eyes, this <hi>Kingdom came not with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</hi> and the approaches of the Enemy in the night of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>viz.</hi> the darkneſs that could be felt of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh century, when all good Learning and Manners too were faſt aſleep, the time when many of the new devices of <hi>Rome</hi> were ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering out, and the noiſe not heard, were not diſcovered, till they had taken poſſeſſion, and then by vertue of Power and great Names defended their Title. And their own Writers confeſs, that many of the great Guardians of Faith, the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> were very Vicious and Illiterate perſons, whoſe Vice and Ignorance kept them nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, while the little Theives, the Notions, and Speculations of

Our Saviour confirms the truth of this when he compares his Church to a Field which had been ſown by him, and his Apoſtles, with very good ſeed, Wheat or ſome other Grain; but while men ſleept, when Chriſtians were grown wicked and careleſs, ignorant or factious, comes the Enemy and ſcatters the Tares, and a new harveſt of Weeds, Heretical Doctrines, Superſtitious Practices, Foppiſh and Phantaſtick <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 24, 25.</note> Rites, over-ran and choakt the purer Grain. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells his <hi>Diſciples, that men of dangerous principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the grace of God, ſpeaking evil of Dignities and deſpiſing Dominions and denying Chriſt that bought them, had creept in unawares,</hi> being well diſguis'd with fine Names and pretences, <note place="margin">Jude 4.</note> while good men were careleſs and ſleept.

Errour and Innovation neceſſarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the utmoſt cunning and ſlyneſs to its aid and aſſiſtance. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion therefore may eaſily ſuffer a conſiderable change, yet good men know not how, neither the time nor authors of it.</p>
                  <p>It being therefore only abſolutely neceſſary for us to know that whenſoever and howſoever theſe errours in the Church firſt ſprung up, that they were contrary to the Primitive Faith of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and therefore were to be amended and weeded up notwithſtanding the common queſtion, where was our harveſt of Wheat before the Weeders our Reformers came? for the Church of <hi>England</hi> finding old Chriſtianity ſtrangely over-grown with the new Doctrines and Creeds of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the Offices of CHRIST, the deſigne of his undertaking for Mankind, and the true ſpirit of his Religion, it became a duty, as much as they lov'd their Souls, and would be true and loyal unto CHRIST, to ſhake off theſe new and ſinful Impoſitions, and reſtore true and primitive Chriſtianity. Had our differences with <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſted only in things leſs fit and proper, uſed by them in their religious Offices, or in Rituals or Geſtures not ſo decent, they might have had ſome pretence to roar againſt us, for breaking off Communion with her, but when they plow up the very Foundation, as one of her Pagan Captains did the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Temple; and lay all waſte before them, their new additions eating out the very Heart of old Religion, to thunder out damnation againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we renounce her Communion in this, is to add uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and other groſs Vices to their former ſin, as though they could not preſerve Chriſtianity, but by defacing of it more. Our Prince being conſtituted by GOD a nurſing Father of the Church,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98824:46"/> and our Biſhops in their Epiſcopal power being co-ordinate with him of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other in the Chriſtian World, ought under the penalty of Damnation, and did accordingly, reform the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> corruptions, which had tainted the Vitals of Chriſtianity; an indiſpenſable duty it <hi>was</hi> to preſerve the Primitive Faith, <hi>like a chaſt Virgin,</hi> and not to ſuffer it to be <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> longer proſtituted to the Deſigns and Paſſions of men by a ſolemn Vow, and our Souls were at ſtake, we had engag'd to preſerve it pure &amp; undefiled, &amp; therefore with all juſt and proper <hi>wayes and methods</hi> we were bound earneſtly to <hi>contend for it.</hi> In duty therefore to our Lord and Maſters Command, at ſuch a time we began our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but wiſh that it had been promoted and compleated many years before, though the ſame Queſtion would have been as fitly asked then, or any other time, except they think that errours muſt be immortal, and the gates of Heaven ſhall not prevail againſt them. The goodneſs and wiſdom of our Reformation, would be readily acknowledg'd and imitated, did not Fame and Ambition, Power, and Secular Intereſt, infect the Eye, and change the natural ſhape and colour of things; and 'tis a ſign the cauſe of <hi>Rome</hi> wants ſtrength, when ſuch a trifling, only popular, Objection againſt our Reformation is made ſo powerful to preſerve their Diſciples in their Communion, and amuſe our own. And we need ſay no more againſt it but this, and 'tis no Roman uncharitableneſs and rigour. That if <hi>Rome,</hi> notwithſtanding all the clear evidence againſt her new and upſtart Opinions, ſhall obſtinately defend them, and contemn a wiſe and pious Reformation, let her ſuffer the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of her wilful errours. He that will prefer an old Diſeaſe before a new Cure, let him be for ever ſick. For we have healed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſhe was not healed.</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE ABOUT TRADITION</head>
                  <p>AN Obligation being laid upon us at our Baptiſm, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and to do the whole will of GOD, revealed unto us by Chriſt Jeſus; it concerns every one that would be ſaved, to enquire where that whole, intire Will of God is to be found? where he may ſo certainly meet with it, and be ſo informed about it, that he may reſt ſatisfied he hath it all?</p>
                  <p>And there would be no difficulty in this matter, had not the worldly intereſt of ſome men, raiſed Controverſies about it; and made that intricate and perplexed, which, in it ſelf, is eaſie and plain. For the Rehearſal of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi> at Baptiſm, and of that alone, as a Summary of the Faith, whoſe ſincere profeſſion intitles us to the Grace there conferred, warrants the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in its VI Article, that the <hi>Holy Scripture containeth all things neceſſary to Salvation, ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this ſtrickes off ſo many of the Doctrines of the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, which are not to be found in the Scripture, nor have any countenance there, that they are forced to ſay, <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi> (mentioned by St. <hi>Jude)</hi> is not intirely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Scripture, but we muſt ſeek for the reſt in the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church. Which Traditions, ſay they, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a part of the Rule of Faith, with the ſame Religious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that we do the Holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now, though this is not really the bottom of their heart (as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98824:48"/> will appear before I have done) but they finally reſt for their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in matters of Faith ſomewhere elſe; yet this being plauſibly pretended by them, in their own Juſtification, that they follow Tradition; and in their Accuſations of us, that we foreſake Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I ſhall briefly let all our People ſee, who are not willing to be deceived, what they are to judge and ſay in this buſineſs of Tradition. About which a great noiſe is made, as if we durſt not ſtand to it, and as if they of the Roman Church ſtedfaſtly kept it, without any variation: neither of which is true. I ſhall plainly ſhew in this ſhort Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <head>The meaning of the Word.</head>
                     <p>Which for clearneſs ſake ſhall begin with the meaning of the word TRADITION: which in Engliſh is no more than <hi>delivering</hi> unto another; and by a Figure, ſignifies <hi>the matter which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;</hi> and among Chriſtians, <hi>the Doctrine of our Religion</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us. And there being two wayes of delivering Doctrines to us, either by <hi>writing</hi> or by <hi>word of mouth;</hi> it ſignifies either of them indifferently: the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as you ſhall ſee preſently being <hi>Traditions.</hi> But cuſtom hath determined this word to the laſt of theſe wayes, and diſtinguiſhed <hi>Tradition</hi> from <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or writings: at leaſt from the Holy Writings; and made it ſignifie that which is not delivered in the Holy Scriptures, or Writings. For though the Scripture be Tradition alſo, and the very firſt <hi>Tradition</hi> and the Fountain of all true and legitimate Antiquity; yet in common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Traditions</hi> now are ſuch ancient Doctrines, as are conveyed to us ſome other way: whither by word of mouth, as ſome will have it, from one Generation to another; or by humane Writings, which are not of the ſame authority with the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>How to judge of them.</head>
                     <p>Now there is no better way to judge aright of ſuch Traditions, then by conſidering theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Authors of them, whence they come.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the matter of them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Their Authority,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The means by which we come to know they derive themſelves from ſuch Authors as they pretend unto; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have any authority to demand admiſſion into our belief-</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, every body knows and confeſſes that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98824:48"/> all Traditions ſuppoſe ſome Author, from whom they originally come, and who is the diliverer of thoſe Doctrines to Chriſtian people: who being told by the preſent Church, or any perſon in it, that ſuch and ſuch Doctrines are to be received, though not contained in the Holy Scriptures, becauſe they are <hi>Traditions;</hi> ought in Conſcience to inquire from whom thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> come, or who firſt delivered them: By which means they will be able to judge what credit is to be given to them, when it is once cleared to them from what Authors they really come. Now whatſoever is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us in Chriſtianity, comes either from Chriſt, or from his Apoſtles, or from the Church [either in General, or in part) or from private Doctors in the Church. There is nothing now called a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Chriſtian World, but proceeds from one or from all of theſe four Originals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And the mater which they deliver to us, (which is next to be conſidered) is either concerning that Faith, and godly life, which is neceſſary to Salvation; or concerning <hi>Opinions, Rites, Ceremonies, Cuſtoms,</hi> and things belonging to Order. Both which, as I ſaid, may be conveyed either by writing or without writing; by the Divine Writings, or by Humane Writings; though theſe two wayes are not alike certain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now it is evident to every underſtanding, that things of both ſorts which are delivered to us, have their Authority, from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Author from whence they firſt come. If that be Divine, their Authority is Divine; if it be onely Humane, their Authority can be no more. And among Humane Authors, if their Credit be great, the Authority of what they deliver it great; if it be little, its Authority is little: and accordingly muſt be accepted with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer Reverence.</p>
                     <p>Upon which ſcore whatſoever can be made appear to come from Chriſt, it hath the higheſt authority, and ought to be received with abſolute ſubmiſſion to it, becauſe he is the Son of God. And likewiſe whatſoever appears to have been delivered by the Apoſtles in his Name, hath the ſame Authority; they being his Miniſters, ſent by Him, as He was by God the Father; and indued with a Divine Power, which atteſted unto them. In like manner, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is delivered by the <hi>Church,</hi> hath the ſame Authority which the <hi>Church</hi> hath: which though it be not equal to the foregoing, (the <hi>Church</hi> having no ſuch Divine Power, nor infallible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Apoſtles had) yet is of ſuch weight and moment, that it ought to be reverenced next to theirs. I mean, the ſenſe of the whole <hi>Church;</hi> which muſt be acknowledged alſo to be of greater or leſſer Authority, as it was nearer or farther off from the times of the Apoſtles. What was delivered by their immediate Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98824:49"/> ought to weigh ſo much with us, as to have the greateſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane Authority; and to be looked upon as little leſs then Divine The Univerſal conſent of the next Generation, is an Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching as near to the former, As the Ages do one to another. But what is delivered in latter times, hath leſs humane Authority, though pretending to come, but without proof, from more early dayes: and hath no Authority at all, if it contradict the ſenſe of the Church, when it was capable to be better acquainted with the mind of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>As for particular Churches, their Authority ought to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by every Member of them, when they profeſs to deliver ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely the ſenſe of the Church Univerſal; and when they determine, as they have power to do, Controverſies of Faith, or decree Rites and Ceremonies (not contrary to GOD's Word) in which every one ought to acquieſce.</p>
                     <p>But we cannot ſay the ſame of that which comes from any <hi>private Doctor</hi> in the Church, Modern or Ancient: which can have no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority than he himſelf was of; but is more or leſs credible, according as he was more or leſs diligent, knowing, and ſtrictly religious.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But to all this, it is neceſſary that it do ſufficiently appear, that ſuch Doctrines do really come from thoſe Authours, whoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> they pretend to be. This is the great, and the only thing, about which there is any queſtion among ſober and judicious perſons. How to be ſufficiently aſſured, that any thing which is not delivered unto us in the Scriptures, doth certainly come, for inſtance, from CHRIST, or his holy <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For in this all Chriſtians are agreed, that whatſoever was delivered by CHRIST, from GOD the Father, or by the Apoſtles from CHRIST, is to be embraced and firmly retained, whither it be written or not written: that makes no difference at all, if we can be certain it came from Him, or them. For what is contained in the Holy Scripture, hath not its Authority, becauſe it is written; but becauſe it came from GOD. If CHRIST ſaid a thing, it is enough; we ought to ſubmit unto it: But we muſt firſt know that he ſaid it; and let the means of knowing it be what they will, if we can certainly know He ſaid it, we yield to it.</p>
                     <p>But how we can be certain (at this diſtance of time, from his being in the World) that any thing now pretending to it, was ſaid by CHRIST, which is not recorded in the Holy Scriptures; there is the buſineſs. And it is a matter of ſuch importance, that it cannot be expected any man ſhould be ſatisfied without very good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it: but he may very reaſonably queſtion, whither many things be not falſely aſcribed unto Him, and unto his Apoſtles;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98824:49"/> which never came from them. Nay, whither thoſe things which are affirmed to be the Doctrines of the Primitive Church, and of the whole Church, be not of ſome later Original, and of ſome particular Church, or private Doctors in the Church: unto whoſe Authority that Reverence is not due, which ought to be paid, and which we willingly give unto the former.</p>
                     <p>Now according to this ſtate of the matter, any good Chriſtian among us (who is deſirous to know the Truth, and to preſerve himſelf from Errour) may eaſily diſcern what <hi>Traditions</hi> ought to be received, and held faſt; and what we are not bound unto, without any alteration; and what are not to be received at all, but to be rejected; and how far thoſe things are from being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, which the Roman Church now would obtrude upon us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Apoſtolical, or ancient Traditions; without any Authority from the Holy Scriptures, or (in truth) any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but their own, and ſome private Doctors, whoſe Opinions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not challenge an abſolute ſubmiſſion to them.</p>
                     <p>But to give every one, that would be rightly informed, fuller ſatisfaction in this buſineſs, I ſhall not content my ſelf with this General Diſcourſe; but ſhall particularly and diſtinctly ſhew what <hi>Traditions</hi> we own, and heartily receive; and then what <hi>Traditions</hi> we cannot own, but with good reaſon re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1 AND in the firſt place we acknowledge that what is now <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> was once only <hi>Tradition,</hi> properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that is Doctrine by word of mouth. In this we all agree, I ſay, that the whole Goſpel or Doctrine of CHRIST, which is now upon record in thoſe Books, we call the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> was once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, when it was firſt preached by our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>Which muſt be noted, to remove that ſmall Objection with which they of the Roman Church are wont to trouble ſome peoples minds, merely from the Name of <hi>Traditions:</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles, requires thoſe to whom he writes, carefully to obſerve; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that famous place, 1. <hi>Theſſ. 2. 15.</hi> Where we find this Exhortation, <hi>Therefore, Brethren, ſtand faſt, and hold the</hi>

                     <p>Behold, ſay they, here are things not written; but delivered by word of mouth; which the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are commanded to hold. Very true, (ſhould the people of our Church ſay, to thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon this) but, behold alſo, we beſeech you, <hi>what</hi> the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of which the Apoſtle here writes; and mark alſo <hi>when</hi> it was that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt of theſe, it is manifeſt that he means by <hi>Traditions,</hi> the Doctrines which we now read in the holy Scriptures. For the very firſt word <hi>therefore,</hi> is an indication that this verſe is an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, from what he had ſaid in the foregoing. Now the things he before treated of, are the grand Doctrines of the Goſpel, or the way of Salvation revealed unto us by Chriſt Jeſus, from God the Father: who <hi>hath from the begining</hi> (ſaith he, v. 13, 14.) <hi>choſen you to Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto he hath called you,</hi> &amp;c. This is the ſum of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and whatſoever he had delivered unto them about theſe matters, of their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or of their <hi>Faith,</hi> or of their <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by <hi>obtaining the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (to which they were choſen, and called, through their Sanctification and Faith) this he exhorts them to hold faſt; whither it was contained in this Epiſtle, or in his former preaching: for he had not occaſion now to write all that he had formerly delivered by word of mouth.</p>
                     <p>Which afterward was put in writing: for mark (which is the ſecond thing) the time <hi>when</hi> ſome things remained unwritten; which was, When this Epiſtle was ſent to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> Then ſome things concerning their ſalvat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And, I ſay, <hi>as yet</hi> unwritten in that Church; becauſe the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> no doubt, had afterward more communicated to them in writing, beſides this Epiſtle, or the former either: <hi>viz.</hi> all the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of Apoſtles, and other <hi>Apoſtolical Epiſtles,</hi> which we now enj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y. Which <hi>Writings,</hi> we may be confident, contain the Traditions which the Apoſtle had delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians, by Word,</hi> concerning the <hi>Incarnation, Birth, Life, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98824:50"/> and concerning the coming <hi>of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>miſſion of the Apoſtles:</hi> and all the reſt which is there recorded for our everlaſting inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is in vain to argue from this place, that there are ſtill, at this day, ſome <hi>unwriten Traditions,</hi> which we are to follow; unleſs the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>Hold the Traditions which ye have been taught by word, which ſhall never be written.</hi> And it is in vain for us to inquire after any ſuch Traditions, or rely upon them, when they are offered unto us; unleſs we were ſure that there was ſomething, neceſſary to our Salvation, delivered in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was never to be delivered in writting; and unleſs we know where to find it, as certainly as we do that which they have committed to writing.</p>
                     <p>And it is to no more purpoſe to ſhew us the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> in other places of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Writings; particularly in the third Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 6. where, by <hi>Tradition,</hi> St <hi>Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> underſtands the Apoſtles Example, which he had given them; and ſo it follows, <hi>v. 7. For your ſelves know how you ought to follow us,</hi> &amp;c, or it may refer to the commandment he had given them in his former Epiſtle, 4. 11. (which the Reader may be pleaſed to compare with this) but cannot with any colour be expounded to ſignifie any Doctrine of Faith, about which the Roman Church now contends with us. For it is plain, it hath reſpect to their good manners, and orderly living: for the information of which, we need go no where, but to the holy Scriptures; wherein we are taught full enough, how we ought to walk and pleaſe GOD in all things.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid of that place, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 2. Now I praiſe you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (or <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as we render it, or <hi>Precepts,</hi> as the vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine it ſelf hath it) <hi>as I have delivered them unto you.</hi> For we are ſo obſervant of what he hath delivered, that we are confident, if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were now alive, and in this Church, he would <hi>praiſe</hi> us (as he doth the <hi>Corinthians)</hi> for <hi>keeping the Traditions as be delivered them;</hi> and on the contrary, reprove and condemn the Roman Church, for not keeping them as they were firſt delivered. And we have good ground for this confidence; there being an inſtance in that very Chapter, which demonſtrates our fidelity in preſerving the very firſt Traditions, and their unfaithfulneſs in letting them go. For he tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 23. that he had <hi>delivered to them what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord:</hi> and that which he received and delivered, was about the <hi>whole Communion</hi> (as you may read there and in the following verſes, 24, 25.) in both kinds; the Cup, as well as the <hi>Bread.</hi> Thus, he ſaith, the Lord appointed it, and thus he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98824:51"/> it: and this Tradition we keep intire, as he <hi>received</hi> it of the Lord, and <hi>delivered</hi> it to his Church, in this Epiſtle, which is a part of the holy Scripture: whereas they do not keep it, but have broken this Divine Tradition, and give the Communion of Chriſt's Body and Blood otherwiſe than St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivered, keeping the Cup from the People.</p>
                     <p>By which I deſire all, that love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, to judge which Church keeps cloſeſt to the <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition</hi> (fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed, according to their firſt intention: when theſe ſacred Rites (for inſtance, the <hi>holy E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>And ſo much may ſerve for the firſt thing: for it would be too long, to explain all the reſt of the places of holy Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure, which they are wont to alledge (though the word <hi>Tradition</hi> be not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in them) to give a colour to their preſent pretences; how pertinently may be judged by theſe places now conſidered.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>Secondly</hi> then, That Word of God which was once unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, being now written, we acknowledge our ſelves to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Church of God in all foregoing Ages, which hath preſerved the Scriptures, and delivered them down to us, as his Word: which we ought to do unto thoſe that ſhall ſucceed us; as our Church teacheth us in its Twentieth Article, where the Church is affirmed to be <hi>a Witneſs and a keeper of holy Writ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Tradition we own, it being univerſal, continued, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and undenied. Though, in truth, this is <hi>Tradition</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe of the word; not ſignifying the Doctrine delivered unto us, but the manner and means of its delivery.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if any Member of our Church be preſſed by thoſe of the Romiſh Perſwaſion, with this Argument, for their preſent <hi>Traditions,</hi> that Scripture it ſelf is come to us by <hi>Tradition,</hi> let them anſwer thus: Very right, it is ſo, and we thank God for it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this be no part of our diſpute, it being a thing preſuppoſed in all Diſcourſes about Religion, a thing agreed among all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, that we read the Word of GOD when we read the holy Scriptures, Which being delivered to us, and accepted by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98824:51"/> us as his Word; we ſee no neceſſity of any other <hi>Tradition</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is not to be found there, or cannot be proved from thence: for they tell us, they are able to make, even the men of God, wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
                     <p>And if they preſs you again, and ſay, How do you know that ſome Books are Canonical, and others not, is it not by a conſtant <hi>Tradition?</hi> Anſwer them again in this manner: Yes, this is true alſo, and would to GOD you would ſtand to this univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and receive no other Books, but what have been ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But know withal, that this <hi>univerſal Tradition</hi> of the Books of Scripture (unto which you have added ſeveral Apocryphal Writings, which have not been conſtantly delivered, as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſe we receive) is no part of the <hi>Tradition or Doctrine delivered.</hi> That is, no Doctrine diſtinct from the Scriptures; but only the inſtrument or means of conveying that Doctrine unto us.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, it is the fidelity of the Church with whom the Canon of Scripture was depoſed; but is no more a Doctrine, not written in the Scripture, then the Tradition or delivery of the <hi>Code,</hi> or Book of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> is any Opinion or Law not written in that <hi>Code.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we are more aſſured of the fidelity of the Church herein, then the Civilians can be aſſured of the Faithfulneſs of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours in preſerving and delivering the Books of their Law to them, becauſe theſe holy Books were alwayes kept with a greater care, then any other Books whatſoever; and in the acceptance of them alſo, we find there was a great caution uſed, that they might not be deceived: all Chriſtians looking upon them to be of ſuch importance, that all Religion, they thought, was concerned in them.</p>
                     <p>Of which, this is an Argument, that they who ſought to deſtroy the Chriſtian Religion, in the Primitive times, ſought nothing more then to deſtroy the Bible. Which they were wont to demand of thoſe who were ſuſpected to be Chriſtians, to be delivered up to them, that they might burn it. And according as men beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in this trial, ſo they were reputed to be Chriſtians or not Chriſtians. And the <hi>Traditours,</hi> as they were called, that is, they who delivered the holy Scriptures into the hands of the Pagans, were look'd upon by Chriſtians, as men that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with their Religion. For which there could be no reaſon, but that they thought Chriſtian Religion to be therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and to be betrayed by thoſe who delivered them to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>By which I have proved more then I intended, in this part of my Diſcourſe; that in the holy Scriptures, the whole Will of God concerning our Salvation, is contained. Which is the true Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98824:52"/> between us and the Church of <hi>Rome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> Not whither the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be delivered to us as the Word of GOD, or no, (in this our People ought to tell them we are all agreed) but whither they have been delivered to us as the whole Will of GOD. And from that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now mentioned, and many more, we conclude, that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Tradition having directed us unto theſe Books and no other, they direct us ſufficiently, without any other Doctrines, unto GOD, and to our everlaſting reſt.</p>
                     <p>And if they urge you farther, and ſay, that the very Credit of the Scripture depends upon Tradition: tell them that it is a Speech not to be endured, if they mean thereby that it gives the Scripture its authority, (and if they mean leſs, we are agreed, as hath been already ſaid) for it is to ſay, that Man gives authority to GOD's Word. Whereas in truth, the holy Scriptures are not therefore of Divine Authority, becauſe the Church hath delivered them ſo to be; but the Church hath delivered them ſo to be, becauſe it knew them to be of ſuch authority. And if the Church ſhould have conceived, or taught otherwiſe, of theſe Writings, then as of the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oracles of GOD, ſhe would have erred damnably in ſuch a Tradition.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſum up what hath been ſaid in this <hi>ſecond</hi> particular, in a few words. Chriſt and his Apoſtles at firſt taught the Church by. word of mouth; but afterward that which they preach'd was by the commandment of GOD commited to writing, and delivered unto the Church, to be the ground of our Faith. Which is no more then <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath ſaid in expreſs words. (L. 3. C. 1.) ſpeaking of them by whom the Goſpel came unto all Nations: <hi>Which they then preached, but afterward, by the Will of GOD delivered unto us in the Scriptures, to be, in time to come, the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>III. And farther we likewiſe acknowledge, that the ſum and ſubſtance of the Chriſtian Religion, contained in the Scriptures, hath been delivered down to us, even from the Apoſtles dayes, in other wayes or forms, beſides the Scriptures. For inſtance, in the <hi>Baptiſmal Vow,</hi> in the <hi>Creed,</hi> in the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> of the Church. Which we may call <hi>Traditions,</hi> if we pleaſe, but they bring down to us no new Doctrine, but only deliver in an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame Chriſtianity which we find in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Upon this there is no need that I ſhould enlarge; but I proceed farther to affirm.</p>
                     <p>IV. That we reverently receive alſo the unanimous <hi>Tradition</hi> or Doctrine of the Church in all Ages, which determines the <hi>meaning</hi> of the holy Scripture, and makes it more clear and unqueſtionable in any point of Faith, wherein we can find it hath declared its
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98824:52"/> ſenſe. For we look upon this <hi>Tradition</hi> as nothing elſe but the <hi>Scripture unfolded;</hi> not a new thing, which is not in the Scripture but the Scripture explained and made more evident.</p>
                     <p>And thus ſome part of the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> may be called a <hi>Tradition;</hi> as it hath expreſly delivered unto us the ſenſe of the Church of GOD concerning that great Article of our Faith, That JESUS CHRIST is <hi>the Son of GOD.</hi> Which they teach us was alwayes thus underſtood, the Son of GOD, <hi>begotten of his Father before all worlds, and of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this Tradition ſuppoſes the Scripture for its ground, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers nothing but what the Fathers, aſſembled at <hi>Nice,</hi> believed to be contained there, and was firſt fetch'd from thence. For we find in <hi>Theodoret (L. 1. C.</hi> 6.) that the famous Emperour <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> admoniſhed thoſe Fathers, in all their Queſtions and Debates to conſult only with theſe heavenly inſpired Writings; <hi>Becauſe the Evangelical and Apoſtolical Books, and the Oracles of the old Prophets, do evidently inſtruct us what to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>k in Divine matters.</hi> This is ſo clear a Teſtimony, that in thoſe dayes they made this compleat Rule of their Faith, whereby they ended Controverſies, (which was the reaſon that in ſeveral other Synods we find they were wont to lay the Bible before them) and that there is nothing in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> but what is to be found in the Bible; that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath nothing to reply to it, but this, <hi>Conſtantine was indeed a great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but no great Doctor.</hi> Which is rather a Scoff, than an Anſwer; and caſts a ſcorn not only upon him, but upon the great Council, who, as the ſame <hi>Theodoret,</hi> witneſſeth, aſſented unto that ſpeech of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> So it there follows in theſe words <hi>That moſt of the Synod were obedient to what he had diſcourſed, and embraced both mutual Concord, and ſound Doctrine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And accordingly, St. <hi>Hilary</hi> a little after extols his Son <hi>Conſtantius</hi> for this, that he adhered to the Scriptures; and blames him only for not attending to the true Catholick ſenſe of them. His words are theſe, (in his little Book which he delivered to <hi>Conſtantius)</hi> I <hi>truly admire thee, O Lord</hi> Conſtantius <hi>the Emperour, who deſireſt a Faith according to what is writen.</hi> They pretended to no other in thoſe dayes; but (as he ſpeaks a little after) look'd upon him <hi>that refuſed this, as Antichriſt.</hi> It was only required that they ſhould receive their Faith out of <hi>God's Books,</hi> not merely according to the <hi>words</hi> of them, but according to their true <hi>meaning,</hi> (becauſe many <hi>ſpake Scripture without Scripture, and pretended to Faith without Faith,</hi> as his words are;) and herein Catholick and conſtant Tradition was to guide them. For whatſoever was contrary to what the whole Church had received and held from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, could not in reaſon be thought to be the meaning of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98824:53"/> that Scripture which was alledged to prove it. And, on the other ſide, the Church pretended to no more then to be a Witneſs of the received ſenſe of the Scriptures; which were the bottom upon which they built this Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thus I obſerve <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> ſaith, (in <hi>Euſeb.</hi> his Hiſtory, <hi>L. 4. C.</hi> 22.) that when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he met with a great many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and that he <hi>received the very ſame Doctrine from them all.</hi> And then a little after, tells us what that was, and whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived it; ſaying, <hi>That in every ſucceſſion of Biſhops, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo they held; as the Law preached, and as the Prophets, and as the Lord.</hi> That is, according to the Doctrine of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude this particular with a pregnant paſſage, which I remember in a famous Divine of our Church, <hi>(Dr. Jacksons,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Catholick Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.) who writes to this effect;</p>
                     <p>That Tradition which was of ſo much uſe in the Primitive Church, was not <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> or Cuſtoms, commended or ratified by the ſuppoſed infallibility of any viſible Church, but did eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt in the <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> or <hi>Regiſters</hi> of particular Churches.

                     <p>In ſhort, the unanimous conſent of ſo many diſtinct viſible Churches, as exhibited their ſeveral Conſeſſions, Catechiſms, or Teſtimonies of their own Forefathers Faith, unto the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> was an argument of the ſame force and efficacy againſt <hi>Arius</hi> and his Partakers, as the general conſent and practice of all Nations, in worſhipping a Divine Power in all Ages, is againſt <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ingrafted notion of a Deity, could have induced ſo many ſeveral Nations, ſo much different in natural diſpoſition, in civil Diſcipline and Education, to effect or practiſe the duty of Adoration. And nothing but the evidence of <hi>the ingrafied word,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:98824:53"/> (as St. <hi>James</hi> calls the Goſpel) delivered by CHRIST and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the holy Scriptures, could have kept ſo many ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as communicated their Confeſſions unto that Council, in the unity of the ſame Faith.</p>
                     <p>The like may be ſaid of the reſt of the <hi>four firſt General Councils;</hi> whoſe Decrees are a great confirmation of our belief, becauſe they deliver to us the conſent of the Churches of CHRIST, in thoſe great Truths which they aſſert out of the holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>And could there any <hi>Traditive</hi> Interpretation of the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be produced upon the Authority of ſuch <hi>Original Tradition,</hi> as that now named, we would moſt thankfully and joyfully receive it. But there never was any ſuch pretended; no, not by the Roman Church, whoſe Doctors differ among themſelves about the meaning of hundreds of places in the Bible. Which they would not do ſure, nor ſpend their time unprofi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>V. But more then this, we allow that <hi>Tradition</hi> gives us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable aſſiſtance in ſuch points as are not in ſo many letters and ſyllables contained in the Scriptures, but may be gathered from thence, by good and manifeſt reaſoning. Or, in plainer words perhaps, whatſoever <hi>Tradition</hi> juſtifies any Doctrine that may be proved by the Scriptures, though not found in expreſs terms there, we acknowledge to be of great uſe, and readily receive and follow it; as ſerving very much to eſtabliſh us more firmly in that Truth, when we ſee all Chriſtians have adhered to it.</p>
                     <p>This may be called a <hi>confirming Tradition:</hi> of which we have an inſtance in the Doctrine of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> which ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers call an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi> Not, that it cannot be proved by any place of Scripture; no ſuch matter: for though we do not find it written in ſo many words that Infants are to be baptiſed, or that the Apoſtles baptiſed Infants; yet it may be proved out of the Scriptures, and the Fathers themſelves, who call it an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> do alledge teſtimonies of the Scriptures to make it good. And therefore we may be ſure they comprehend the Scriptures within the name of <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition;</hi> and believed that this Doctrine was gathered out of the Scriptures, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly treated of there.</p>
                     <p>In like manner we, in this Church, aſſert the authority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops above Presbyters, by a Divine right, as appears by the Book of Conſecration of Biſhops, where the perſons to be ordained to this Office, expreſſes his belief, <hi>That he is truly called to this Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the will of our LORD JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> Now this we
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98824:54"/> are perſwaded may be plainly enough proved to any man that is ingenuous, and will fairly conſider things, out of the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> without the help of <hi>Tradition:</hi> but we alſo take in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of this for the conviction of gain-ſayers; and by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual practice and Tradition of the Church from the beginning confirm our Scripture proofs ſo ſtrongly, that he ſeems to us very obſtinate, or extreamly prejudiced, that yields not to them. And therefore to make our Doctrine in this point the more authentick, our Church hath put both theſe Proofs together, in the Preface to <hi>the Form of giving Orders;</hi> which begins in theſe words: <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident unto all men, diligently reading the holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time there have been three Orders of Miniſters in Chriſt's Church; Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> hope no body among us is ſo weak, as to imagine, when he reads this, that by admitting <hi>Tradition</hi> to be of ſuch uſe and force as <hi>I</hi> have mentioned, we yield too much to the Popiſh Cauſe, which ſupports it ſelf by this pretence. But if any one ſhall ſuggeſt: his to any of our people, let them reply, That it is but the pretence, and only by the Name of <hi>Tradition,</hi> that the Romiſh Church ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it ſelf: For <hi>true Tradition</hi> is as great a proof againſt Popery, as it is for Epiſcopacy, The very foundation of the Popes Empire (which is, his ſucceſſion in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy) is u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>terly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this; the conſtant Tradition of the Church being evidently againſt it. And therefore let us not loſe this Advantage we have againſt them, by ignorantly refuſing to receive true and conſtant <hi>Tradition;</hi> which will be ſo far from leading us into their Church, that it will never ſuffer us to think of being of it, while it remains ſo oppoſite to that which is truely Apoſtolical.</p>
                     <p>I conclude this with the Direction which our Church gives to Preachers in the Books of <hi>Canons,</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>VI. But though nothing may be taught as a piece of Religion; which hath not the forenamed Original; yet I muſt add, that thoſe things which have been univerſally believed, and not contrary
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98824:54"/> to Scripture, though not written at all there, nor to be proved from thence, we do receive as pious Opinions. For inſtance, the <hi>perpetual Virginity</hi> of the Mother of GOD our Saviour; which is ſo likely a thing, and ſo univerſally received, that I do not ſee why we ſhould not look upon it as a genuine <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VII. I have but one thing more to adde, which is, that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the Church, about matters of <hi>Order, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Only we do not take them to be parts of GOD's worſhip; and if they be not appointed in the holy Scriptures, we believe they may be altered by the ſame or the like authority, with that which ordained them. So our Church hath excellently and fully reſolved us concerning ſuch matters, in the XXXIV Article of Religion? where there are <hi>three</hi> things aſſerted concerning ſuch <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It is not neceſſary that Traditions and Ceremonies</hi> (they are the very firſt words of the Article) <hi>be in all places, one or utterly alike for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diverſities of countries, times, and mens manners, ſo that nothing be ordained againſt God's Word.</hi> But then to prevent all diſorders and confuſions, that men might make in the Church, by following their own private fancies and humours; the next thing which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>whoſoever through his own private judgment, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and purpoſelie doth openlie break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of GOD, and be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved by common authority; ought to be rebuked openlie (that others may fear to do the like) as he that offendeth againſt the common Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the church, and hurteth the Authority of the Magiſtrate, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the conſciences of the weak Brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtlie,</hi> It is there declared, That <hi>every particular or National church, hath authority to ordain, change, and aboliſh ceremonies or Rites of the church, ordained only by man's authority, ſo that all things be done to edifying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew what we believe concerning <hi>Traditions,</hi> about matters of Order and Decency.</p>
                     <p>VIII. As for what is delivered in matters of Doctrine, or Order, by any private Doctor in the church, or by any particular church, it appears by what hath been ſaid, that it cannot be taken to be more then the private Opinion of that man, or the particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of that church, and can have no more authority then they have: that is, cannot oblidge all chriſtians, unleſs it be contained in the holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuch are the Traditions which the Roman church would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us, and impoſe upon us after a ſtrange faſhion, as you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98824:55"/> ſhall ſee in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of this Diſcourſe: unto which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed preſently, when <hi>I</hi> have left with you this brief Reflection on what hath been ſaid in this <hi>Firſt Part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our people may hereby be admoniſhed not to ſuffer themſelves to be deceived and abuſed by words and empty names, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſenſe and meaning. Nothing is more common then this; eſpecially in the buſineſs of <hi>Traditions.</hi> About which a great ſtir is raiſed, and it is commonly given out, that we refuſe all Traditions, Then which, nothing is more falſe: for we refuſe none truly ſo called; that is, Doctrines delivered by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles. No, we refuſe nothing at all, becauſe it is unwritten; but merely becauſe we are not ſure it is delivered by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to which we ought to ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever is delivered to us by our LORD and his Apoſtles, we receive as the very word of God; which we think is ſufficiently declared in the holy Scriptures. But if any can certainly prove, by any Authority equal to that which brings the Scriptures to us, that there is any thing elſe delivered by them, we receive that alſo. The Controverſie will ſoon be at an end. For we are ready to embrace it, when any ſuch thing can be produced.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we have that reverence for thoſe who ſucceeded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that what they have unanimouſly delivered to us, as the ſenſe of any doubtful place, we receive it, and ſeek no farther. There is no diſpute, whither or no we ſhould entertain it.</p>
                     <p>To the Decrees of the Church alſo we ſubmit in matters of Decency and Order; yea, and acquieſce in its authority, when it determines doubtful Opinions.</p>
                     <p>But we cannot receive that as a Doctrine of Chriſt, which we know is but the Tradition of man, nor keep the Ordinances of the ancient Church in matters of Decency, ſo unalterably as never to vary from them; becauſe they themſelves did not intend them to be of everlaſting obligation. As appears by the changes that have been made in ſeveral times and places; even in ſome things which are mentioned in the holy Scriptures, being but Cuſtoms ſuted to thoſe Ages and Countries.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, <hi>Traditions</hi> we do receive; but not all that are called by that name. Thoſe which have ſufficient Authority; but not thoſe which are impoſed upon us, by the ſole authority of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, aſſuming a power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AND in the firſt place we do not believe that there is any <hi>Tradition</hi> which contains <hi>another Word of God;</hi> which is not in the Scripture, or cannot be proved from thence. In this conſiſts the main difference between us and them of the Romiſh Perſwaſion, who affirm that Divine Truth which we are all bound to receive, to be partly written, partly delivered by word of mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writting. Which is not only the affirmation of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but delivered in more expreſs t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rms, in the Breſace to the <hi>Roman Catechiſm,</hi> drawn up by their order; where we finde theſe words (towards the concluſion of it) <hi>The whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be delivered to the faithfull, is contained in the Word of GOD; which</hi> (Word of GOD) <hi>is diſtributed into Scripture and Tradition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a full and plain declaration of their mind; with which we can by no means agree, for divers unanſwerable reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not only becauſe the Scriptures teſtifie to their own perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which they aſſirm to be ſo great, as to be able to compleat, the divineſt men in the Church of CHRIST, in all points of heavenly wiſdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. 16. 17. but,</p>

                     <p n="3">3 And we have this farther reaſon ſo to do, becauſe if part of God's Word had been written, and part unwritten, we cannot but believe there would have been ſome care taken, in the written Word, not onely to let us know ſo much, but alſo inform us whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we should reſort to find it, and how we ſhould know it; if it be abſolutely neceſſary for us to be acquainted with it.

                     <p n="4">4. For which we have ſtill this farther reaſon, that no ſooner were they that firſt delivered and received the holy Scriptures gone out of the world, but we find men began to adde their own fancies unto the Catholick Truth; which made it abſolutely neceſſary to keep to the Tradition in the holy Scriptures, all other growing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. This is obſerved by <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> himſelf (in <hi>Euſeb. l. 3. c.</hi> 32) that <hi>the Church remained a chaſt Virgin, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, till the Sacred Quire of the Apoſtles, and the next Generation of them, who had had the honour to be their Auditonrs, were extinct; and then there began a plain Conſpiracie of impious atheiſtical errour, by the fraud of Teachers, who delivered other Doctrine,</hi> Which was a thing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> feared even in his own life time, about the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> [2 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 3.) leſt the Devil, like a wily Serpent, ſhould beguil them, and corrupt their minds from the original ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Doctrine wherein they were firſt inſtructed. And if it were attempted then, it was leſs difficult, and therefore more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured afterward; as ſhall appear anone by plain Hiſtory, which tells how ſeveral perſons pretended they received this and that from an Apoſtle. Some of which Traditions were preſently reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; others received, and afterwards found to be impoſtures. Which ſhews there was ſo much falſe dealing in the caſe, that it was hard for men to know what was truely Apoſtolical in thoſe dayes, if it came to them this way onely; and therefore impoſſible to be diſcerned by us now, at this great diſtance of time from the Apoſtles, who we know delivered the true Faith; but we have no reaſon to rely upon mere Tradition, without Scripture, for any part of that Faith; when we ſee what Cheats were put upon men by that means, even then when they had better helps to detect them then we have.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the Fathers ſometime urge, Tradition a as proof of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98824:56"/> what they ſay. But we muſt know, that the Scriptures were not preſently communicated among ſome barbarous Nations, and there were ſome Hereticks alſo who either denied the Scriptures, or ſome part of them, and in theſe caſes it was neceſſary to appeal to the Tradition that was in the Church, and to convince them by the Doctrine taught every where by all the Biſhops. But that (mark this, I pray you) of which they convinced them by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, was nothing but what is taught in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. With which we cannot ſuffer any thing to be equalled in authority, unleſs we would ſee it confirmed by the ſame or equal Teſtimony. This is the great reaſon of all, why we cannot admit any unwritten Traditions to be a part of the Word of GOD, which we are bound to believe, becauſe we cannot find any truths ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us, as thoſe in the holy Scriptures. They come to us with as full a Teſtimony as can be deſired, of their Divine Original; but ſo do none of thoſe things which are now obtruded on us by the Romiſh Church, under the name of <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>For the Primitive Church had the very firſt Copies and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Writings of thoſe Books called the New Teſtament, delivered by the Apoſtles own hands to them. And thoſe Book confirm the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament: and they were both delivered to Poſterity by that Primitive Church, witneſſing from whom they received them; who carefully kept them as the moſt precious Treaſure: ſo that this written Word hath had the general appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and teſtimony of the whole Church of Chriſt in every Age, untill this day, witneſſing that it is Divine. And it hath been the conſtant buſineſs of Doctors of the Church, to expound this Word of GOD to the People: and their Books are full of Citations out of the Scripture; all agreeing in ſubſtance with what we now read in them. Nay, the very Enemies of chriſtianity, ſuch as <hi>Celſus, Porphyry, Julian,</hi> never queſtioned but theſe are the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of which the Apoſtles were the Authors, and which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. Beſides, the Marks they have in themſelves of a Divine Spirit, which indited them, they all tending to breed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in men a ſenſe of GOD, and to make them truly vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>

But if it be not there, <hi>What obſtinacy is this</hi> (as it follows a little after in that Epiſt l. 24. <hi>(what preſumption, to prefer human Tradition, before the Divine Diſpoſition or Ordinance?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A great deal more there is in that place, and in others of that holy Martyr, to bring all to the <hi>ſource, the root, the original of the Divine Tradition; for then human errours ceaſes:</hi> which original Tradition he affirms to be what is delivered in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which delivering to us the whole Will of GOD concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, we look after no other Tradition, but what explains and confirms, and is conſonant to this. For we believe that what is delivered to us by the Scriptures, &amp; what is delivered by true Tradition, are but two ſeveral waves of bringing us acquainted with the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truth, not with different parts of that Truth.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I have done with the firſt thing; the ſum of which, is this: We do not receive any Tradition or Doctrine to ſupply the defect of the Scripture, in ſome neceſſary Article of Faith; which Doctrines they of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to have one and the ſame Author with the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> God: and therefore to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame pious affection and reverence. But cannot tell us where we may find them, how we ſhall diſcern true from falſe, nor give us any aſſurance of their Truth, but we muſt take them purely upon their word.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98824:57"/>
                     <p>Now how little reaſon we have to truſt to that, will appear in the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing I have to adde, which is this:</p>
                     <p>11. That we dare not receive any thing whatſoever, merely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Credit of the Roman Church; no not <hi>that divine, that holy Tradition</hi> before ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scripture. Which we do not believe onely upon their teſtimony, both becauſe they are but a part of the Church, and therefore not the ſole Keepers of Divine Truth; and they are a corrupted part who have not approved themſelves faithful in the keeping what was committed to them.</p>
                     <p>Let our People diligently mark this, That Traditions never were, nor are now, onely in the keeping of the Roman Church: and that theſe things are widely different; the Tradition of the whole Church, or of the greateſt and beſt part of it; and the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of one part of the Church, and the leaſt part of it: and the worſt part alſo and moſt depraved.</p>
                     <p>What is warranted by the Authority of the whole Church, I have ſhewn before, we reverently receive: but we cannot take that for current Tradition, which is warranted only by a ſmall part of the Church, and we give very little credit to what is warranted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that part of it which is <hi>Roman.</hi> Becauſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Church hath not preſerved ſo carefully as other Churches have done, the <hi>firſt and orginal Tradition,</hi> which is in the Scriptures; but ſuffered them to be ſhamefully corrupted. Every one knows that there is a <hi>Latin Vulgar</hi> Edition of the Bible (which they of that Church prefer before the Original) none of which they preſerved heretofore from manifeſt deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor have been able, ſince they were told of the faults, to purge away; ſo as to canonize any Edition without permitting great numbers in their neweſt and moſt approved Bibles. <hi>Iſidore Clarius</hi> in his Preface to his Edition, complains that he fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd theſe holy Writings defaced with innumerable errours: <hi>Eight thouſand</hi> of which, that he thought moſt material, he ſaith he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and yet left he knew not how many leſſer ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched: After which (the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> having vouched this Vulgar Latine Edition, for the onely authentick) Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> publiſhed, out of the ſeveral Copies that were abroad, one which he ſtraightly charged to be received, as the onely true Vulgar; from which none ſhould dare to vary in a tittle. And yet two years were ſcarce paſsed, before <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Eight,</hi> found many defects and corruptions ſtill remaining in that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98824:58"/> Edition; and therefore publiſhed another with the very ſame charge, that none elſe ſhould be received.</p>
                     <p>Which evidently ſhews they have ſuffered the holy Books to be ſo fouly abuſed, that they know not how to amend the errours that are crept into them, nor can tell which is the true Bible. For theſe two Bibles thus equally authorized as the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick ones, abound not only with manifeſt diverſities, but with contradictions, or contrarieties one to the other. Whereby all Romaniſts are reduced to this miſerable neceſſity, either to make uſe of no Bible at all; or to fall under the curſe of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> if he make uſe of that of <hi>Clement:</hi> or the curſe of <hi>Clement,</hi> if he uſe the Bible of <hi>Sixtus.</hi> For they are both of them enjoyned with the excluſion of all other Editions; and with the penalty of a Curſe upon them, who diſobey the one or the other; and it is impoſſible to obey both.</p>
                     <p>This might be ſufficient to demonſtrate how unfaithful that Church hath been, in the weightieſt concerns. Whereby all the Members of are plunged beyond all power of redemption, into a diſmal neceſſity, either of laying a ſide the Scriptures, or of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the ſacred Decrees (as they account them) of one or other of the heads of their Church (which ſome take to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) and being accurſed of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, But for every one's fuller ſatisfaction, it may be fit farther to repreſent how negligent they have been in preſerving other <hi>Traditions,</hi> which were certainly once in the Church, but now utterly loſt. There is no queſtion to be made, but the Apoſtles taught the firſt Chriſtians the meaning of thoſe hard places which we find in their and other holy Writings. But who can tell us where to find certainly ſo much as one of them? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where is the fidelity of this Church, which boaſts ſo much to be the Keeper of ſacred <hi>Traditions?</hi> For nothing is more deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then theſe Apoſtolical Interpretations of Scripture; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more uſeful; and yet we have no hope to meet with them either there, or indeed any where elſe. Which is no reproach to other Churches, who do not pretend to more then is written; but refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For of what ſhould they have been more careful then of theſe uſeful things, whereof they can tell us nothing? when of unprofitable Ceremonies they have moſt devoutly kept, if we could believe them, a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They tell us indeed of ſome doctrinal <hi>Traditions</hi> alſo which

                        </gap> it is evident had no hand in them; which is another reaſon why we cannot give credit to their reports, if we have no other authority. There are very few perſons now that are ignorant how many <hi>Decretal Epiſtles</hi> of the ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have been deviſed, to eſtabliſh the Papal Empire; and how ſhamefully a Donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> hath been pretended, wherein he gave away the Roman Empire and all its Rights to the Pope. Which puts me in mind (as a notorious proof of this) of the Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that are in the <hi>Breviary</hi> it ſelf, where we read of <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> Leproſie; and the cure of it by <hi>Sylveſter's</hi> baptizing him (which are egregious Fables) and of the Decrees of the ſecond Roman Synod under that Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> wherein the <hi>Breviary</hi> affirms <hi>Photinus</hi> was condemned: when all the world knows that <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> his Hereſie did not ſpring up till diverſe years after the death of <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> And there are ſo many other Arguments which prove the Decrees of that Synod to be a vile forgery, that we may ſee, by the way, what reaſon they have to keep their Liturgy in an unknown Language; leaſt the people perceiving what untruths they are taught, inſtead of God's Word, ſhould abhor that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, as juſtly they might, which is ſtuffed with ſo many Fables.</p>
                     <p>It would be endleſs to ſhew how many paſſages they have foiſted into ancient Writers to countenance their Traditions, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly about the Papal Supremacy; by which ſo great a man as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was deceived: who frequently quotes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which are mere Forgeries, though not invented by him, I verily think, but impoſed upon him by the fraud which had been long practiſed in that Church. For we find that the Canons of ſo famous and univerſally known Council as that of the firſt at <hi>Nice,</hi> have been falſely alledged even by Popes themſelves. <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> for inſtance, and <hi>Zoſimus</hi> alledged a counterfeit <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon to the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops in the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> who to convince the falſe dealing of theſe Popes, ſought out with great labour and diligence, the ancient and authentick Copies of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons; and having obtained them both from <hi>Alexandria</hi> and from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they found them for number and for ſenſe to be the very ſame which themſelves already had; but not one word in them of what the Popes pretended. The ſame <hi>I</hi> might ſay of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> and others, whom <hi>I</hi> purpoſely omit, becauſe I ſtudy brevity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And have this farther to adde, that as they have pretended
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98824:59"/> 
                        <hi>Tradition;</hi> where there is none; ſo where there is, they have left that <hi>Tradition:</hi> and therefore have no reaſon to expect that we ſhould be governed by them in this matter, who take the liberty to neglect, as they pleaſe, better Tradition then they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us. None are to be charged with this, if it be a guilt, more then themſelves. For inſtance, the <hi>three Immerſions:</hi> i. e. dipping the Perſons three times in Baptiſm, was certainly an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practice, and ſaid, by many Authors, to be an Apoſtolical Tradition; and to be ordained in ſignification of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, into whoſe name they were baptized, And yet there is no ſuch thing now in uſe in their Church, no more then in ours; who juſtifie our ſelves, as I ſhewed above, by a true opinion, that Rites and Ceremonies are not un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lterable: which it is impoſſible for them to do, unleſs they will ceaſe to preſs the neceſſity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Traditions upon us, which never were ſo generally received, as this which is now aboliſhed. To which may be added the cuſtome of giving the <hi>Euchariſt to Infants,</hi> which prevailed for ſeveral Ages, and is called by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition;</hi> the cuſtome of adminiſtring Baptiſm onely at <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide;</hi> with a great heap more, which would be too long to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate. Nor it is neceſſary I ſhould trouble the Reader with them, theſe being ſufficient to ſhew the partiality of that Church in this matter; and that we have no reaſon to be tied to that, merely upon their Authority, which they will not obſerve, though having a far greater. Nay, all diſcreet perſons may eaſily ſee what a wide difference there is between them who have abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Traditions as had long gone even in their Church, under the name of Apoſtolical; and us who therefore do not follow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Traditions now, becauſe we believe them not to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, but merely Roman. He is ſtrangely blind, who doth not ſee how much more ſincere this Church is then that, in this regard.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Beſides this, we can demonſtrate, that as in theſe things they have forſaken Traditions, ſo in other caſes they have perverted and abuſed them, turning them into quite another thing. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to all that underſtand any thing of ancient Learning, in the buſineſs of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> which none of the moſt ancient Writers ſo much as dream'd to be ſuch a place as they have now deviſed; but only aſſerted a <hi>Purgatory-Fire:</hi> through which all, both good and bad, even the bleſſed Virgin her ſelf, muſt paſs, at the great and dreadful day of Judgement. This was the old Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as we may call it, which was among Chriſtians; which they have changed into ſuch a Tradition as was among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:98824:59"/>6. But it is time to have done with this; elſe I ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon this a while, which I touched before, and is of great moment, That <hi>the Tradition which now runs in that Church, is contrary to the certain Tradition of the Apoſtles and the univerſal Church;</hi> particularly in the <hi>Canon of Scripture.</hi> In which no more Books have been numbered by the Catholick Church in all Ages, ſince the Apoſtles time, then are in the VI. Article of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> till the late council of <hi>Trent</hi> took the boldneſs to thruſt the <hi>Apoeryphal Books</hi> into the holy Canon, as nothing inferiour to the acknowledged Divine Writings, This hath been ſo evidently demonſtrated by a late Reverend Prelate of our Church, in his <hi>Scholaſtical Hiſtory of the Canon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> out of undoubted Records, that no fair anſwer can be made to it.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt leave a little room for other things that ought to be noted.</p>
                     <p>III. And the next is a conſequence from what hath been now ſaid. That there being ſo little credit to be given to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church onely, we cannot receive thoſe Doctrines of Truth which that Church now preſſes upon our belief, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Tradition. For inſtance, That <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mother and Miſtriſs of all other Churches;</hi> That <hi>the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Monarch or Head of the univerſal viſible Church:</hi> That <hi>all Scriptures muſt be expounded according to the ſenſe of this Church;</hi> That <hi>there are truly and properly ſeven Sacraments, neither more nor leſs, inſtituted by our bleſſed Lord himſelf in the New Teſtament:</hi> That <hi>there is a proper and propiciatory Sacrifice offered in the Maſs for the quick and dead, the ſame that Chriſt offered on the Croſs.</hi> In ſhort, the <hi>half communion,</hi> and all the reſt of the Articles of their New Faith, in the Creed publiſhed by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which are Traditions of the Roman Church alone, not of the Univerſal; and rely ſolely upon their own Authority. And therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them; and in our Diſputes about Traditions, we mean theſe things; which we reject, becauſe they have no foundation, either in the holy Scripture, or in univerſal Tradition; but depend, as I ſaid, upon the ſole Authority of that Church, which witneſſes in its own behalf.</p>
                     <p>For whatſoever is pretended, to make the better ſhew, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves at laſt into that; as I intimated in the beginning of this Diſcourſe. Scripture and Tradition can do nothing at all for them, without their <hi>Churches definition.</hi> Though their whole infallible Rule of Faith ſeem to be made up of thoſe <hi>three,</hi> yet in truth, the laſt of theſe alone, the <hi>Churches definition,</hi> is the whole Rule, and the very bottom upon which their Faith ſtands. For
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98824:60"/> what is Tradition, is no more apparent, then what is Scripture, according to their Principles, without the Authority of their church, which pretends an unlimited power to ſupply the defect even of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort as Tradition among them is taken in to ſupply the defect of Scripture; ſo the Authority of their Church is taken in to ſupply the defect of Tradition: But this Authority undermines them both, becauſe neither Scripture nor Tradition ſignifie any thing, without their Churches Authority. Which therefore is the Rule of their Faith; that is, they believe themſelves.</p>
                     <p>To which abſurdity they are driven, becauſe it is made evident by us, that there have been great diverſities of Traditions, and many changes and alterations made, even in things called Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore they have no other way, but to fly to the judgment of the preſent Church, to determine what are Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions Apoſtolical, and what are not: by which Judgment all mankind muſt be governed; that is, we muſt believe them, and they believe themſelves: which they would have done well to have ſaid in one word, without putting us to the trouble of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Traditions in Books, and in other Churches. But they would willingly colour their pretences by as many fair words as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſo make mention of <hi>Scripture, Tradition, Antiquity;</hi> which when we have examined, they will not ſtand to them, but take fanctuary in their own Authority, ſaying, They are the ſole Judges what is Scripture, and what Tradition, and what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; nay, have a power to declare any new point of Faith, which the Church never heard of before. This is the Doctrine of <hi>Salmeron</hi> and others of his fellows: That <hi>the Doctrine of Faith admits of additions in eſſential things. For all things were not taught by the Apoſtles, but ſuch as were then neceſſary and fit for the Salvation of Believers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which means we can never know when the Chriſtian Religion will be perfected; but their Church may bring in <hi>Traditions</hi> by its ſole Authority, without end.</p>
                     <p>Nay, ſome among them have been contented to reſolve all their Faith into the ſole Authority of the preſent Roman Biſhop; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that famous ſaying of <hi>Cornelius Muſſus</hi> (promoted by <hi>Paul</hi> the Third to a Biſhoprick) upon the fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: To confeſs the truth ingenuouſly, I would give greater credit to one Pope, in thoſe things which touch the myſteries of Faith then to a thouſand</hi> Hierom's, Auſtin's, Gregory's; <hi>to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of</hi> Richard's, Scotus's, <hi>&amp;c. For I believe and know that the Pope cannot erre in matters of Faith.</hi> Which contemptuous
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98824:60"/> Speech he would never have uttered, to the diſcredit of thoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom they pretend to reverence, if he had not known more certainly that the Tradition which runs among the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is againſt them, then he could know the Pope to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
                     <p>There is no Tradition, I am ſure for that; nor for abundance of other things, which reſt merely upon their own credit; as is fairly acknowledged in two great Articles of their preſent Creed by our Countrey-man Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> with whoſe words I conclude this particular. <hi>Many perhaps have the leſs confidence in Indulgences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their uſe ſeems to have been newer in the Church, and very lately found among Chriſtians. To whom I anſwer, that it doth not appear certainly by whom they began to be firſt delivered. For the Ancients make no mention, or very rare, of Purgatory; and the Greeks to this very day do not believe it: nor was the belief either of Purgatory or of Indulgences ſo neceſsary in the Primitive Church, as it is new. And as long as there was no care about Purgatory, no body ſought for Indulgences: for all their eſteem depends upon that. If you take away Purgatory, to what purpoſe are Indulgences? Since therefore Purgatory was ſo lately known and received in the Catholick Church, who can wonder that there was no uſe of Indulgences in the beginning of our Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which is a full Confeſſion what kind of <hi>Traditions</hi> that Church commends unto us: things lately invented; their own private Opinions, of which the ancient Chriſtians knew nothing. In one word, their Tradition is no Tradition, in that ſenſe wherein the Church alwayes underſtood it.</p>
                     <p>IV. And what hath been ſaid of them, muſt be applied to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Churches; though ſome have been more ſincere then they. None of them hath any Authority to commend any thing as an Article of Faith unto Poſterity, which hath not been commended to them by all foregoing Ages, derived from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For <hi>Vincentius</hi> his Rule is to guide us all in this: <hi>That is Catholick</hi> (and conſequently to be received) <hi>which hath been held by all, and in all churches, and at all times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>V. Which puts me in mind of another thing to be briefly touched, that the Eccleſiaſtical Tradition contained in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions or Regiſters of particular Churches in theſe days wherein we live, is not received by us, nor allowed to have the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which ſuch Tradition had at the time of the Nicene Council, for the conviction of Hereſie. The joynt conſent I mean of ſo many Biſhops as were there aſſembled, and the unanimous Confeſſions of ſo many ſeveral Churches of ſeveral Provinces, as were there delivered, hath not now ſuch a force to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98824:61"/> belief as it had then. The reaſon of which is given by the ſame <hi>Vicentius,</hi> who ſo highly commends that way which was then taken of reproving Hereſie; but adds this moſt wiſe Caution (in the laſt Chapter but one of the firſt part of his <hi>commonitorium,)</hi> But you muſt not think that all Hereſies, and all wayes, are thus to be oppoſed; but only new and freſh Hereſies: when they firſt riſe up, that is, before they have falſified the Rules of the ancient Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for inveterate Hereſies, which have ſpred themſelves, they are in no wiſe to be aſſaulted this way; becauſe in a long tract of time many opportunities may have preſented themſelves to Hereticks of ſtealing Truth out of the ancient Records, and of corrupting the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of our Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>Which if it be applied to the preſent ſtate of things, it is evident the Roman Church hath had ſuch opportunities of falſifying Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ever ſince the firſt acknowledgment of the <hi>Papal Supremacy</hi> that we cannot rely merely upon any written Teſtimonies, or unwritten Traditions, which never ſo great a number of their Biſhops met together ſhall produce; which amount not to ſo much as one legal Teſtimony, but they are to be look'd upon or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a multitude of falſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> conſpiring together in their own cauſe.</p>
                     <p>How then, may ſome ſay, can Hereſies of long ſtanding, be confuted? The ſame <hi>Vincentius</hi> reſolves us in this, in the very next words: We may convince them, if need be, by the ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures? or eſchew them as already convicted and condemned in ancient times, by the general Councils of Catholick Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>The Tradition which is found there, muſt direct all future councils not the Opinions of their preſent churches.</p>
                     <p>IV. I will adde but one thing more; which is, That the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> called <hi>Oral,</hi> becauſe it comes by word of mouth from one Age to another, without any written Record, is the moſt uncertain, and can be leaſt relied upon of all other. This hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated ſo fully by the Writers of our Church, and there are ſuch pregnant inſtances of the errours into which men have been led by it, that it needs no long diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Two inſtances of it are very common, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall adde a third.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt is that which <hi>Papias,</hi> who lived preſently after the Apoſtles times, and converſed with thoſe who had ſeen them ſet on foot. His way was, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates out of his Works, not ſo much to read, as to enquire of the Elders what Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid; what was the Saying of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>James,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples of our LORD. And he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98824:61"/> pretended that ſome of them told him, among other things, that after the reſurrection of our Bodies, we ſhall reign a thouſand years here upon Earth: which he gathered, ſaith <hi>Euſebius,</hi> from ſome Saying of the Apoſtles, wrong underſtood. But this Fancy was embraced very greedily, and was taught for two whole Ages, as an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition;</hi> no body oppoſing it: and yet having nothing to ſay for it, but only <hi>the antiquitie of the man</hi> (as <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> his words are, <hi>L. 3. cap. ult)</hi> who delivered it to them: yet this Tradition hath been generally ſince taken for an impoſture, and teaches us no more then this: That if one man could ſet a going ſuch a Doctrine, and make it paſs ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for ſo long a time, upon no other pretence then that an Apoſtle ſaid ſo in private diſcourſe; we have great reaſon to think that other Traditions have had no better beginning, or not ſo good; eſpecially ſince they never ſo univerſally prevailed as that did.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſecond</hi> inſtance is that famous contention about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> which miſerably afflicted the Church in the dayes of <hi>Victòr</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ròme,</hi> by dividing the Eaſtern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the Weſtern. One pretending Tradition from Saint <hi>Jòhn,</hi> and Saint <hi>Philip;</hi> the other from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Concerning which I will not ſay, as <hi>Rigaltius</hi> doth (in his ſharp note upon the words of <hi>Firmilian,</hi> who pretended Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the rebaptizing of Hereticks,) That under the Names and Perſons of great men, there were ſottiſh and ſophiſtical things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for Apoſtolical Traditions, by Fools and Sophiſters. But this I affirm, that there are many more inſtances of mens forwardneſs, and they neither Fools nor Sophiſters, but onely wedded to the Opinions of their own Churches, to obtrude things as Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, for which they had no proof at all. For when they knew not how to defend themſelves, preſently they flew to Tradition A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third inſtance of whoſe uncertainty we have in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> (L. 2. <hi>c.</hi> 39.) concerning the age of our bleſſed Saviour when he died, which he confidently affirms to have been forty, if not fifty years: and ſaith the Elders which knew St. <hi>John,</hi> and were his Scholar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, received this relation from him. And yet all agree, that he beginning to preach at <hi>thirtie</hi> years of age, was crucified about three years and an half after.</p>
                     <p>The like relation <hi>Clement</hi> makes of his preaching but one year; which he calls a ſecret Tradition from the Apoſtles: but hath no more truth in it then the other.</p>
                     <p>Now if in the firſt Ages, when they were ſo near the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and beginning of Tradition, men were deceived, nay ſuch
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98824:62"/> great men as theſe were deceived, and led others into errours in theſe matters; we cannot with any ſafety truſt to Traditions that have paſſed, men pretend, from one to another until now; but we can find no mention of in any Writer, till ſome Ages after the Apoſtles; and then were by ſome body or other, who had authority in thoſe dayes, called Apoſtolical Traditions; merely to gain them the more credit. Thus <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis</hi> in his commentaries upon the Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> p. 743. Saith, that the coming of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> before the ſecond coming of Chriſt (though it be not found in Scripture) was a conſtant report received by <hi>Tradition without any variation,</hi> from the Teachers of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Which is ſufficient to ſhew how ready they were to father their own private Opinions upon ancient univerſal Tradition; and how little reaſon we have to truſt to that which was ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, even in the firſt Ages; and therefore muſt needs be more dubious now.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have endeavoured to lay before the eyes of thoſe who will be pleaſed to look over this ſhort Treatiſe, what they are to think and ſpeak about <hi>Tradition.</hi> It is a calumny to affirm, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> rejects all Tradition; and I hope none of her true Children are ſo ignorant, as when they hear that word, to imagine they muſt riſe up and oppoſe it. No, the Scripture it ſelf is a Tradition; and we admit all other Traditions which are ſubordinate, and agreeable unto that; together with all thoſe things which can be proved to be Apoſtolical by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Teſtimony of the Church in all Ages: nay, if any thing not contained in Scripture, which the Roman Church now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a part of GOD's Word, were delivered to us by as univerſal uncontroulled Tradition as the Scripture is, we ſhould receive it as we do the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But it appears plainly that ſuch things were at firſt but private Opinions, which now are become the Doctrines of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church; who would impoſe her Decrees upon us under the Venerable Name of Apoſtolical Univerſal Tradition; which I have ſhewn you hath been an ancient Cheat, and that we ought not to be ſo eaſie as to be deceived by it. But to be very wary, and afraid of truſting the Traditions of ſuch a Church, as hath not only perverted ſome, aboliſhed others, and pretended them where there hath been none; but been a very unfaithful preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them and that in matters of great moment, where there were ſome; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> warrants thoſe which it pretends to have kept, by nothing but its own infallibility. For which there is no <hi>Tradition,</hi> but much againſt it, even in the Orignal <hi>Tradition,</hi> the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98824:62"/> holy Scriptures; which plainly ſuppoſe the Roman Church may not only erre, but utterly fall and be cut off from the Body of Chriſt: as they that pleaſe may read, who will conſult the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans, v.</hi> 20, 21, 22. Of which they are in the greater danger, becauſe they proudly claim ſo high a Prerogative as that now mentioned; directly contrary to the Apoſtolical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition in that place: <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi>

                     <head>CONCLUSION</head>
                     <p>I Shall end this Diſcourſe with a brief Admonition, relating to our Chriſtian Practice.</p>
                     <p>And what is there more proper, or more ſeaſonable then this? While we reject all ſpurious Traditions, let us be ſure to keep cloſe to the genuine and true. Let us hold them faſt, and not let them go.</p>
                     <p>Let us not not diſpute our ſelves out of all Religion, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that which is falſe; nor break all Chriſtian Diſcipline and Order, becauſe we cannot ſubmit to all humane Impoſitions.</p>
                     <p>In plain words, let us not throw off <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> together with the <hi>Papal Tyranny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ought to be the more careful in obſerving the Divine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition delivered to us in the Scripture; and according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe we are not bound to other.</p>
                     <p>While we contend againſt the <hi>half Communion,</hi> let us make a conſcience to receive the <hi>whole</hi> frequently. It looks like Faction rather then Religion, to be earneſt for that which we mean not to uſe.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, while we look upon additions to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as vain, let us not neglect to read and ponder thoſe holy Writtings.</p>
                     <p>When we reject <hi>Purgatory</hi> as a Fable, let us really dread Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire.</p>
                     <p>And while we do not tye our ſelves to all uſages that have been in the Church, let us be carful to obſerve, <hi>firſt,</hi> all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Duties of Righteouſneſs, Charity, Sobriety, and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are unqueſtionably delivered to us by our LORD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his holy Apoſtles: and <hi>ſecondlie,</hi> all the Ordinances of the Church wherein we live, which are not contrary to the Word of GOD. For ſo hath the ſame Divine Authority delivered, that the people ſhould obey thoſe that are their Guides and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98824:63"/> ſubmitting themſelves to their authority, and avoiding all contention with them, as moſt undecent in it ſelf, and pernicious to Religion; which ſuffers extreamly, when neither <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> nor <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Cuſtom,</hi> can end diſputes about Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>Read. 1 <hi>Theſs. 5. 12. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 16. and read ſuch places, as you ought to do all the other Scriptures, till your hearts be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them.</p>
                     <p>For be admoniſhed, in the laſt place, of this; which is of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, and muſt never be forgotten, becauſe we ſhall loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that Coeleſtial Doctrine which is delivered unto us; if we do not ſtrictly obſerve it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> That <hi>as this Evangelical Doctrine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down to us, ſo we muſt be delivered up to it.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us to ſpeak, in 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. where he thanks GOD that they who formerly had been ſervants of ſin, did now <hi>obey from the heart that form of Doctrine unto which they were delivered.</hi> So the words run in the Greek (as the Margin of our Bibles inform you) <hi>cis bon paredothnie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Tradition which we muſt be ſure to retain, and hold faſt above all other; as that without which, all our belief will be ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>This is the very end for which all Divine Truth is delivered unto us, that we may be delivered and make a ſurrender of our ſelves unto it.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve the force of the Apoſtles words; which tell us, firſt, that there was a certain form of Chriſtian Doctrine which the Apoſtles taught, compared here to a mould (ſo the word <hi>Typos, form,</hi> may be tranſlated) into which Mettal or ſuch-like matter is caſt, that it may receive the figure and ſhape of that mould.</p>
                     <p>2. Now he compares the Roman Chriſtians to ſuch ductile, pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able matter; they being ſo delivered or caſt into this form or mould of Chriſtian Doctrine, that they were intirely framed and faſhioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, and had all the lineaments, as I may ſay, of it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>3. And having ſo received it, they were obedient to it: for without this all the impreſſions, which by knowledge of Faith were made upon their ſouls, were but an imperfect draught of what was intended in the Chriſtian Tradition.</p>
                     <p>4. And it was hearty obedience, ſincere compliance with the Divine Will; ſuch obedience as became thoſe who underſtood their Religion to be a great deliverance and liberty from the ſlavery of ſin (before ſpoken of) into the happy freedom of the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>5. All which, <hi>laſtly,</hi> he aſcribes to the grace of God, which had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98824:63"/> both delivered to them that Doctrine, and drawn them to deliver up themſelves to it, made their hearts ſoft and ductile to be caſt into that mould, and quickned them to Chriſtian Obedience, and given them a willing mind to obey chearfully. All this was from God's grace, and not their merits; and therefore the thanks was to be aſcribed to him, who ſucceeds and bleſſes all pious endeavours.</p>
                     <p>Now according to this pattern, let us frame our ſelves, who, bleſſed be God, have a form of Doctrine delivered to us in this Church, exactly agreeable to the holy Scriptures, which lie open before us; and we are exhorted not onely to look into them, but we feel that grace which hath brought them to us, clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating that we ought to be formed according to the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein delivered, by the delivery of our ſelves to it. By the delivery of our mind, that is, to think of God, and our ſelves, and of our duty in every point, juſt as this inſtructs us. And by the delivery of our wils and affections, to be governed and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, according to its directions. And when we have conſented to this, we find the Divine grace repreſenting to us the neceſſity of an hearty obedience, to what we know and believe, and have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as the very Truth of God. To this we are continually drawn and mightily moved; and if we would ſhew our thankfulneſs for it, let us follow theſe godly motions, and conform our ſelves in all things to the heavenly preſcriptions of this Book, being confident that if we do, we need not trouble our ſelves about any other model of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we find not here delivered.</p>
                     <p>For if you deſire to know what <hi>form of Doctrine</hi> it is, to which the Apoſtle would have us delivered, it is certain it is a Doctrine directly oppoſite to all vice and wickedneſs. For herein the grace of God was manifeſted, he tells the <hi>Romans,</hi> in that it had brought them from being ſlaves of ſin, heartily to obey the Chriſtian Doctrine; which taught, that is, Vertue and Piety.</p>
                     <p>Now to this the preſent Romaniſts can pretend to adde nothing. All the parts of a godly life are ſufficiently taught us in the holy Scriptures. And if we would ſeriouſly practiſe and follow this Doctrine from the very heart, we ſhould eaſily ſee there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but what is there delivered. For whatſoever is pretended to be neceſſary beſides, is not <hi>a Doctrine according unto godlineſs</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls Chriſtianity) but the very deſign of it is to open an eaſier way to Heaven then that laid before us in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by <hi>Maſſes for the dead,</hi> by <hi>Indulgences,</hi> by <hi>Sanctifications,</hi> and the <hi>merits of the Saints,</hi> and ſeveral other ſuch like inventions; which have no foundation in the Scriptures, nor in true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                     <p>That is a word indeed which is very much pretended. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98824:64"/> they ſay, is on their ſide; but it is nothing different from what hath been ſaid about Tradition. And if we will run up to the true Antiquity, there is nothing ſo ancient as the holy Scriptures. They are the oldeſt records of Religion; and by them if we frame our lives, we are ſure it is according to the moſt authentick and ancient directions of Piety, delivered in the holy Oracles of God. So both ſides confeſs them to be. And if the old Rule be ſafe. <hi>that is true which is firſt,</hi> we are ſafe enough: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before this to be our Guide; and there can be nothing after this, but muſt be tried by it. According to another Rule, as old as Reaſon it ſelf; <hi>The firſt in every kind, is the meaſure of all the reſt.</hi> And, as ſure as that there is a Goſpel of GOD'S grace, <hi>they that walk after this Rule</hi> (this Divine <hi>Canon) peace ſhall be upon them, and mercy;</hi> they being the true <hi>Iſrael;</hi> or Church, <hi>of God.</hi>

                  <head>THE UNITY OF THE CATHOLICK CHURCH Maintained in the CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHoſoever with an impartial eye, and a truly religious concern for the Honour of GOD, the Credit of the Goſpel, and the Salvation of Men, looks into the eſtate of Chriſtendom; he will ſcarce find any greater cauſe of ſorrowful Reflections then from the many Diviſions, and Animoſities, which have diſtracted, and ſeparated its parts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe have opened the mouths, and whet the tongues of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enemies to reviling Invictives and profane Scoffs againſt our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, and his holy Religion, and ſtifled the firſt thoughts of admitting the moſt convincing Truths to a debate among Jews, Turks, or Pagans, and ſtopt their ears againſt the wiſeſt Charms.</p>
                  <p>To no one cauſe can we more reaſonably impute the ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which Chriſtianity hath made in the World for a thouſand years paſt. The ſame conteſts have as pernicious influence at home upon the Faith or manners of thoſe within the Pale of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Men are hereby too ſoon tempted into ſome degrees of Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm about very material Points of Chriſtian Doctrine, in which they obſerve ſo many to differ among themſelves. Others are the more eaſily ſeduced to ſeek and make much of all Arguments, whereby to baffle or weaken the cleareſt evidences for their conviction: and they ſeldom continue long in the ſame perſwaſion with thoſe, with whom they will not maintain the ſame Communion. Thus Schiſms have generally ended in Hereſies.</p>
                  <p>As miſchievous are the effects of theſe Diſtractions upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Chriſtians. There are many vitious, and diſorderly paſſions; ſuch as Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Revenge, Pride, Cenſoriouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:98824:65"/> which take Sanctuary therein, and under that ſhelter put in their claim for the height of Chriſtian Graces, and the moſt holy zeal for GOD and his Cauſe. Every where they break, or looſen the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, which ſhould guard its children from doing amiſs, or reſtore them after it, when the laſt and moſt capital puniſhment of being thruſt out of its Communion is like to be little dreaded, where many voluntarily deſert it with the higeſt pretences of better advantage elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Now though this matter of fact, confirmed by woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be a ſubject too ſad for a long meditation, or paſſionate enlargement, yet is it no more then what might have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, without a Spirit of Propheſie, to follow from the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and depraved eſtate of mankind not otherwiſe rectified. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſuppoſe that our ever bleſſed Saviour, in the Foundations of his holy Inſtitution, made all needful proviſion to prevent theſe fatal miſcariages.</p>
                  <p>By the ſufficient Revelation of all Fundamental Articles of Belief. By the as full Declaration of all the neceſſary precepts of a good life. By inculcating frequently, and preſſing moſt emphatically thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands concerning Love, Peace, Unity, Good Order, Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> directly oppoſed to thoſe contentions, in every Page of the New Teſtament: Theſe it may ſuffice but to name.</p>
                  <p>It will ſoon be granted, after the beſt proviſion of Rules, and moſt convincing Arguments and Motives to ſtrengthen them, that there will be need of ſome Government to encourage all in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, to reſtrain ſome from offering violence to them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for many emergencies.</p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed LORD and Maſter, therefore, for the better ſecurity of his Truth, and the ſafer conduct of thoſe which adhere to it, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd a Society or Church in the World, which he purchaſed with the moſt ineſtimable price, dignified with the higheſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, encouraged with the largeſt Promiſes, back'd with the moſt ample Authority, and will alwayes defend with the ſtrongeſt Guard, againſt all Power, or Policy on Earth or under the Earth; ſo that, as he hath told us, <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now where this Church is to be found, and what are the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our Obligation to it, hath been a long and great debate, eſpecially between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> In moſt of their late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial Books they have ſeemed ready to wave diſputes about particular points, in hopes of greater advantage, which they promiſe themſelves from this venerable name, and that bold, though moſt falſe and preſumptuous claim which they lay to the thing it ſelf, even excluſive to all others; which will appear from the true, but ſhort and plain ſtate of the caſe between us, the chief deſign of this attempt,</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:98824:66"/>
                  <p>Now that we may not charge them, nor they us falſly or raſhly;</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It may be convenient <hi>firſt,</hi> to lay down ſome Principles concerning this Church in which they and we ſeem moſtly agreed though all our Writers expreſs not themſelves alike clearly herein.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To propound the chief Bands of Unity within this Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To mark out the moſt obvious Defections from them by the Romaniſts.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. To ſhew the Reformation in the Church of <hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and was framed with all due regard to the preſervation of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. To clear it of the moſt common Objections.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. To conſider the ſtrong obligations from hence upon all ſorts of Diſſenters among us to embrace, and continue in its ommunion.</p>
                  <p>I. The former will ſoon be diſpatcht, which I reduce to the following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Bleſſed Saviour alwayes had, and alwayes will have a Church in the World, in which his Doctrine hath been, and ſhall be ſo far profeſt, and his Sacraments ſo effectually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, that they who rightly improve them may not want neceſſary ſupplies for their preſent ſpiritual life, or future hopes of Salvation: though the extent of the Church as to its boundaries, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in degrees may be vaſtly different at one time, and in one place from another. This many Propheſies in the Old Teſtament, and Promiſes from our Saviour in the New give abundant ground for our Faith to rely upon, and the experience of all Ages hitherto hath confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this Church is a diſtinct Society within it ſelf, furniſhed with ſufficient Authority in ſome to Govern, and Obligation in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be ſubject, neceſſary to every Society; which the power of the Keyes given by our Lord to received in or ſhut out, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Diſcipline from Divine Precept, and Scripture Example e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince beyond all exception. But then this Eccleſiaſtical Power in whomſoever placed, or ſtrained to what height ſoever, can never extend to vacate, or change the expreſs Inſtitution of Chriſt, or take away our Obligation to his revealed Truth and direct Commands. In caſe of any competition the Apoſtles defence may be ours, <hi>We muſt obey God rather then man.</hi> And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> profeſſion, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> And again, <hi>If we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Church muſt be viſible, as every Society is more or leſs, whoſe parts are ſo, and whoſe Profeſſion muſt be ſo. Our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98824:66"/> entrance into it is in a viſible manner by Baptiſmal Initiation. Our oblidged Communion with it is in diverſe outward ſenſible Acts, which the repreſentation of it by a Body or Building might prove. More clearly is it likened to a <hi>city on a Hill, which cannot be hid,</hi> Mat. 5. 14. Set up as the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> an Enſign to the Gentiles, which all Nations ſhould flee unto, or elſe it would witneſs againſt them: wherein its Followers ſhould take Sanctuary, and find a Refuge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Within theſe Boundaries we have the only hopes of ſafety here and happineſs hereafter. What GOD may do by his ſupereminent unaccountable power in an extraordinary caſe is preſumption for us but to inquire into. Out of this Atk there is no proſpect given to us of any eſcape from the Univerſal Deluge. <note n="a" place="margin">S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. 60 p. 143. Ed.

                     </note> All the ſpiritual Promiſes concerning this life or a better are made to this Church, the Members of this Body who is the Head. Therefore the Apoſtles preach to Jews and Gentiles the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of receiving this Character. <hi>Seeing there is no other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> as St, <hi>Peter</hi> atteſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This church is but one. It is an Article of our Faith, expreſt in our Creed to believe it ſo. For <hi>there be many members, yet but one Body. One Spirit</hi> quickning all; <hi>One LORD,</hi> and Head over all; <hi>One GOD</hi> and Father of all; <hi>one Faith; one Baptiſm; one Hope</hi> of our Calling in all, as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Eph. 4. 4. 5. 6. 7, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Now we are to enquire what are the chief Bands of Unity in the Church which make, keep, and evidence it to be one; How we may ſecure our ſelves within this Garden encloſed, this Spring

Likewiſe into whatever
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98824:68"/> Office, or Miniſtration any are orderly admitted in one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the ſame are they to be acknowledged in all others, though without that particular Juriſdiction which they had in their own. But whoſoever lies under any cenſure in one Church, he is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed under the ſame in all others, and not to be received into communion till the Sentence be reverſed by the ſame power, or a ſtile higher, and greater Authority; according to the <hi>Fifth Canon of the Council of Nice,</hi> and the deſign of their <hi>form'd</hi> and <hi>communicatory Letters,</hi> without which none were to paſs from one Church to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Thus every Church is accountable to its Neighbour Churches, and ſo to the whole Church for its Actions, that one may not do, what the other undoes, without any regard to this Unity, which would lead to the confuſion and diſtraction of all.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Diſcipline,</hi> if Unity of Government in all parts be not indiſpenſably neceſſary to it, yet it will be ſo far, as not to abrogate, or invade the poſitive Inſtitutions of our Saviour himſelf herein, and be more then convenient, that it be as confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, as it is in our power to make it in one place, to what it is in another. It ſeems horribly preſumptuous, violently to thruſt out of the Church that Government under the influence of which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity hath been conveyed, and preſerved from the Age of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the moſt diſtant places, upon pretence of erecting a new better Scheme or model of our own, or becauſe of the intricate uſe of one or two terms in Scripture, when the Church was in its firſt formation, though againſt the plain current of it in other places, and the uninterrupted tradition of the whole Church. A Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed muſt be more or leſs perfect according to its Government,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98824:69"/> for ſuitable will be the Exerciſe and Authority of its Diſcipline. What allowance may be made for thoſe, who deſire to come as near as they can to the Primitive Patern, though it be not in their power to reach it in many conſiderable points, I am not now to diſpute. But moſt inexcuſable, and highly obnoxious are they, that by extreme violence, and uſurpation endeavour to deſtroy what they found regularly eſtabliſhed to their hands.</p>
                  <p>III. But we are here moſt concerned with the bold claims of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> amidſt their moſt obvious Defections, who have made it the principal Band of Unity in the Catholick Church to be ſubject to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the pretended Vicar of Chriſt therein, as the Univerſal Head, and Monarch of the Church: this they have determined as <hi>de fide,</hi> and put into their very Creed, and excluded all that do not expreſly own it.</p>
                  <p>But againſt this as a great breach of Chriſtian Unity we have many juſt exceptions, and been always ready to prove them ſo <note n="a" place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold juriſdiction Dr. <hi>Barrow's</hi> Treatiſe of the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note>

But then this power became moſt intolerable when it was made uſe of to purpoſes ſo much worſe then it ſelf, which were beſide the former;</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The weakning of the power of Temporal Princes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Civil Rights of men. <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cracanthorp</hi>'s defence of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and againſt the Popes temporal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note> Although our bleſſed Saviour aſſured <hi>Pilate his Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> yet his pretended Vicar here on earth can hardly ſay ſo: for beſide the Temporal Dominions unto which he hath entitled himſelf a Soveraign Prince, there are few other Kingdoms, or States on this ſide of the world in which he hath not, or had not almoſt as great a ſhare of the Government, as their immediate Princes; at leaſt ſo far as to preſcribe bounds to their Adminiſtrations, and ſubject in great meaſure all Laws, and Perſons to his Foreign Courts, Juriſdiction, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, yea, their Purſes to his Exactions; and upon the leaſt diſpute hath withdrawn ſo great a number of his immediate dependants, who ſcarce own any other Governours, and raiſed ſo many diſturbances, that great Princes and States have been forced at laſt to yield. Not to mention the Arrogance it at length grew up unto in dethroning Princes, giving their Kingdoms to others, authorizing their Subjects to rebel againſt them, or all wayes to oppoſe them, and what oft follows, if not expreſſed, to murder them: as in their late Sentence againſt ſome of our Neighbour Princes.</p>
                  <p>But before, much of this may be ſeen in the long contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome of the Weſtern Emperours, particularly <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the Popes, as we have them diſcribed in their own Authors <note n="b" place="margin">Sigonius de regno Italiae;</note> Alſo to go no farther, their various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with ſeveral of our Kings, eſpecially <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond and the almoſt continual complaints in all our Parliaments before the Reformation of the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98824:71"/> made by them upon the Civil Rights of Prince and Subject by vexatious and chargeable ſuits and appeals as far as <hi>Rome;</hi> by Inſolencies and diverſe Rapines committed under the ſhelter of their protection, and defended from due puniſhment, and by their extravagant Extortions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> abundantly prove.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe Uſurpations grew by degrees, and were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in a different manner according to the condition of thoſe they had to do with, or the temper of him that managed them; yet they muſt needs ſeem more or leſs grievous to all, when power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient was not left to the greateſt Monarchs to defend themſelves, or protect their Subjects, preſerve the peace, or promote the welfare, and provide for the ſecurity of their own Countries. Then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if ſome of them grow weary of ſo inſupportable oppreſſions, and at laſt take courage to grapple with, and extricate themſelves from ſuch manifeſt encroachments upon their own, and the Peoples Civil Rights, as well as the Eccleſiaſtical of the Church in their Dominions, and be forced to ſome harſh and almoſt violent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, when the more gentle and benign could prevail nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But beſide theſe more publick Invaſions upon Church and State, that which made the uſurpation more odious and inſufferable was the farther abuſe of the ſame extravagant power to bring in ſtrange and dangerous Doctrines, corrupt, and unlawfull practices into the Church, and impoſe them upon all in their Communion, exactly fitted to feed their Ambition, enrich their Coffers, ſecure their Authority, and promote their eaſe and Luxury. Such of the <hi>firſt ſort</hi> are their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and Purgatory, of Merit, and Supererogation, the multiplicity of Vows, and deluſions in the Principles of Repentance, and miniſtration of Penance. Of the <hi>latter ſort</hi> are the Invocation of Saints, and Angels, Adoration of Reliques and Images, their half Communion, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lock'd up, and Divine Service performed in an unknown tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe and diverſe like them have proved great Scandals abroad, and ſtumbling blocks at home, and whatever varniſh they may put upon them by the faireſt pretences, or however they may caſt a miſt before the eyes of their Diſciples by nice diſtinctions, yet they have ſo disfigured the face of Chriſtianity, that he who compares the late appearances of it in the world with the model of it laid down in Scripture, or the Records of the Primitive Church, can hardly believe it the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>But the particulars are not here to be diſputed, they have ſufficiently been confuted, and expoſed by Proteſtant Writers, and were by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral before excepted againſt, and diſclaimed, though ſome ſuffered
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98824:71"/> ſeverely for ſo doing, and many more we may ſuppoſe waited an opportunity to free themſelves from their preſſure. That which I am now moſt to inſiſt upon is this, that if the charge we draw up againſt theſe of falſhood in judgment, groſs Superſtition or Idolatry in Worſhip, and immorality in manners, be true and impartial, as we have been ever ready to make good, and ſhall do againſt all the Artifices of the Defendants; Then no Authority whatever regularly founded, or unexceptionably conveyed, can oblidge us to theſe, againſt the revealed Will, or Word of God, the Dictates of our Conſciences, as we hope carefully, and righty informed; the ſenſe and reaſon of mankind, and the Belief and practice of the Church in the firſt and pureſt Ages.</p>
                  <p>Greater cauſe was there to endeavour by all lawful means to throw off ſuch an uſurped power, that made ſo ill uſe of what it had unjuſtly gotten, and to reſtore Religion to its primitive beauty in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Precepts of Life.</p>
                  <p>But alas many difficulties lay in the way of its accompliſhment, and all poſſible ſtruglings, and contentions by force and policy were uſed by the adverſe Party to prevent its beginning, or obſtruct it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Great was their Intereſt in every place; Strong was the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they had upon perſons in Authority; Numerous were their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants and Dependants at home and abroad; Weighty was their concern which lay at ſtake, and many were the advantages which they had of any that oppoſed them: So that no wonder if a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo long wiſh'd for, and much wanted were ſo ſlowly effected. It is rather more ſtrange that in ſo many places it did maſter theſe and ſuch like incumbrances, and in ſo ſhort a time made ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a progreſs. If in ſome places it proceeded with leſs Order, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and calmneſs then could have been wiſh'd for in a Religious Reformation, Neceſſity in part, with many perplexed difficulties and incumbrances, may in ſome meaſure excuſe what no Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand fully warrants.</p>
                  <p>IV. But leaving others to anſwer for themſelves, in my next par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I am to conſider how regularly, and ſedately it proceeded in the church of <hi>England</hi> within the bounds of catholick Unity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With the concurrence, and encouragement all along of the Supreme Power to free it from any but ſuſpicion of Rebellion. So it began at firſt with the breaking of the Papal yoke of Supremacy, the Tranſlation of the Bible, and ſome like preparatives to Reformation under <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> and the united Suffrages of his Parliaments, and the Biſhops themſelves therein. It proceeded ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to a further improvement in moſt particulars under his Son <hi>Edward the Sixth.</hi> And at laſt it came to its full ſettlement and eſtabliſhment under <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> The beginning and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98824:72"/> on of the Reformation here was by ſuch loyalty of Principles, and Practices that we challenge any Church in the World to a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therein. Indeed this was ſo notorious, that her Roman Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſares have turned her Glory into a Reproach by upbraiding her, though moſt invidiouſly, with the name of a <hi>Parliamentary Religion;</hi> becauſe it received all along ſo much countenance and aſſiſtance from thoſe great Aſſemblies of all the three Eſtates of the Kingdom under their Head and Soveriagn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But farther to clear her of all juſt imputation from hence, it muſt be added that the whole work was carried on with the advice, and mature deliberation of the Clergy aſſembled in Convocation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the intire body of them, and therein a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. That they from their Education, and preſumed Knowledge, as well as from their Office, and Eccleſiaſtical Authority are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fitteſt to judge, debate, and determine of Religious matters will be ſoon granted: But that the civil Power may and ought ſometimes to remind them of their Duty, and reſtrain them from groſs Defections from it, may be proved by ſeveral Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Old Teſtament, and the Supereminence of their place. But happy is that Order and Unity in which both Powers are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the ſervice of GOD, the ſecurity of his Church, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his true Religion, as it was here: though it could not be expected but the firſt attempts would meet with ſeveral difficulties, fierce Debates, and Controverſies, yet ſtill the entire eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ratified by the regular determination of the Clergy ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled as before, as well as was after confirmed by the Royal Aſſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Yet farther to juſtifie themſelves from any affected innovation in ſuch a change, all was done with the greateſt Reverence, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and Deference to the Ancient Church to clear their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Unity therewith.</p>

And for other determinations in the <hi>Negative</hi> ſhe only declares thereby how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſhe is to receive or own the falſe or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt additions to the firſt unalterable Rule. No church hath profeſſed and evidenced a more awful and tender regard to Antiquity next to the expreſs Word of GOD. Both which ſhe oft appeals to, deſires to be ruled by; and where their footſteps are not ſufficiently clear, chooſes not to impoſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her own Children, nor cenſure her Neighbours; keeps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the moſt ſafe, and modeſt boundaries; is not forward in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining nice and intricate diſputes, which have perplexed and confounded many in their haſty and bold Poſitions, particularly about the Divine Decrees, and ſuch like ſublime Points. In which few underſtand where the main ſtreſs of the Controverſie lies. It may be none can comprehend the depth of the matters upon which the Deciſion ought to grounded. But alas how many have been forward to lay down, and fiercely contend for, on each ſide, their private opinions herein as the firſt Rudiments of Theology, to be placed in their very Creeds or Catechiſms, and ſo a foundation muſt be laid for endleſs Conteſts and Diviſions? But moſt cautious hath our Church been in not laying ſuch occaſions to fall in the way of any: So that both ſorts of Adverſaries have made their complaints againſt her for not being poſitive, and particularly in ſuch Declarations, though none can charge her juſtly with defect in any point of Faith ſo owned in the beſt Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As clear, and unexceptionable hath been her proceeding in <hi>Church Government,</hi> preſerving that form, which from all Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Antiquity hath continued in the Church from the very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, under the conduct, and happy Influence of which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity hath been propagated, and continued throughout the World whatever different meaſures ſome other Reformed Churches have taken, whither forc'd by neceſſity, or ſwayed by particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or prejudice. The Church of <hi>England</hi> kept up the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received diſtinct prime Orders of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons: not deſiring to cenſure others, who can beſt anſwer for themſelves, but endeavouring to confine her ſelf to what was moſt Canonical, and Regular, and to ſhew how little affected ſhe was to alteration from any eſtabliſhment, except in notorious corruptions and abuſes: And how neceſſary ſhe thought due Order and Subordination in the Church to prevent Schiſms and Hereſies, and to give the greater Authority
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98824:73"/> and advantage to her Miniſtrations; and finally to free her ſelf from all ſuſpicion of irregularity in her Succeſſion, derived down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which ſhe, as much as any Church in the World, may pretend unto. And though ſome intermediate Ages have been blemiſhed with much degeneracy, yet ſhe was concerned only to ſeparate this, but retain, and convey down to others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever good and wholſome proviſion ſhe received from thoſe before. Farther, to evince this, particular care was taken by expreſs Law <note n="a" place="margin">See the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 25 of <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. cap. 19. Sect. 7 expreſly revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 1 <hi>Eliz,</hi> c. 1. ſect. 6.</note> to confirm the Rules of Government, or <hi>Canon Law</hi> before received in the Church till ſome better proviſion could be made ſo far as it contradicts not the Law of the Land, or the Word of GOD; making as few changes in the outward face of the Church as was poſſible, and ſenſibly proving it her deſign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly not to deſtroy, but build, nor yet therein to erect a new, but reform an old Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Alike Canonical, and orderly hath been her Conſtitution in matters of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Her Forms of Prayer and Praiſe with the whole order of her Liturgy are compoſed with the greateſt temper, and expreſſed in the moſt plain and comprehenſive terms to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uniform devotion, pious Affection, the moſt Orthodox Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and catholick communion. So that I think it may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally affirmed, that there is not any thing required in her publick Service neceſſary to thoſe who communicate with her, which any that own the name of chriſtians, or are owned for ſuch by the general body of them, can almoſt ſcruple: unleſs becauſe it is a <hi>Form,</hi> by one ſort, and becauſe it is <hi>ours</hi> by another ſort. But how unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able herein are both? So careful ſhe hath been to lay the ground of moſt catholick Unity, and to remove whatever might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it.</p>
                  <p>This our Adverſaries the Romaniſts confirmed by their own practice, when for ſeveral years, as we have been told <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Camdeni Eliz.</hi> an. 1570</note> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, they frequented our churches, joyn'd in our Prayers and Praiſes, attended on our Sermons and other Inſtructions, and received (as ſome add) our Sacraments, according to the order for ſubſtance the ſame as now, and had it is like done ſo ſtill, having nothing to object againſt them but from the after-prohibition of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had reaſon to fear they who were ſo well provided of all needfull ſupply, and defence at home might thus by degrees be withdrawn from ſubjection to his Authority abroad; that darling point never to be diſpenſed, or parted with, whatever elſe might have been yielded <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>Our Reformers who compoſed our <hi>Liturgy</hi> carefuly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98824:73"/> collected the remainders of true Primitive Devotion <note n="a" place="margin">

Therefore it is ſo far from being an objection, that any part of our Liturgy was tranſlated from the Roman Offices, that while nothing is retained contrary to wholſome Doctrine, and ſound Piety, it is a convincing argument of her impartial Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and deſire to preſerve Uniformity, as much as poſſible, with all chriſtians abroad, as well as at home in her own Members: ſecuring all the Subſtantials of Worſhip according to the plain ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the pattern of the Primitive church.</p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ſhe is ſenſible when they are too numerous how apt they are to darken the inward, and more eſſential luſter of Religion, and prove a burden inſtead of a Relief to its Worſhip, which ſhe takes notice <note n="c" place="margin">Preface to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer concerning Ceremonies why ſome are aboliſhed.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complain'd of in his time: But have ſince ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the Eaſtern, as well as Weſtern Churches, that it muſt argue a great aw to make the Service look like any thing ſerious and Sacred. However this number alone, where the particulars are not otherwiſe obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, tempts ſome to ſpend all their zeal therein, and diverts them from things more neceſſary, or gives too much occaſion to others to quarrel about them. Yet withal being apprehenſive how needful it would be to maintain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Decency, She hath kept ſome, though very few, and thoſe moſt plain, and unexceptionable in their nature, moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative of the end for which they were appointed, and moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and univerſal in their Inſtitution, and practice, hinted in the tittle of our Liturgy as it is changed from the former. And to prevent all differences hereabout, ſhe hath expreſſed her ſenſe of them ſo clearly, and explicitely, that one would think no peeviſh obſtinacy had room to interpoſe a ſcruple however the event hath proved.</p>
                  <p>Thus abundantly hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> vindicated her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from all pretence of Apoſtacy from the True Ancient, Catholick and Apoſtolick Church, and ſhewed in all inſtances how careful ſhe hath been <hi>to preſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi> with all the Members thereof. Nor hath ſhe been wanting in any reſpect or reverence due thereunto. No Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cautious, and ſparing in its determinations, more Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical in its Impoſitions, more Regular in its Succeſſion, and more charitable in its Cenſures: making all neceſſary proviſion, for her own Children ſo within the bounds of Catholick Unity, that had other Churches obſerved the

                  <p>Upon which Premiſes an eaſie Solution is given to the old cavilling queſtion, Where was your Church before the Reformation, or that time?</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, Juſt where it is: Thereby no new Church was ſet up; no new Articles of Faith brought in: no new Sacraments; no new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood to miniſter in holy things: all which would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed required new Miracles, and a new immediate Authority from Heaven ſo atteſted; only the old were purged from impurities in Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practice, which, in paſſing through ſo many degenerate Ages, they had contracted, and that an ordinary Power might ſuffice to do. If we were in the Catholick Church before, we are ſo ſtill, and hope, to better purpoſe. We are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of it, becauſe there raſh Cenſures have excluded us, and then they unreaſonably take advantage to argue againſt us from their own act: We never formally ſhut them out what ever they have done to us.</p>
                  <p>What degrees of corruption in Faith or Manners may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the bare being of a Church, or the poſſibility of ſalvation therein, is needleſs and dangerous for us nicely to enquire: it may be impoſſible for us to know. I am ſure it is moſt ſafe for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what we know to be amiſs, and to leave thoſe who do not, to ſtand or fall by their own Maſter. It is a very ill requital of our Charity if it be turned into a weapon of offence to wound. or ſlay

The beſt ſecurity that we know to meet it with comfort will be to uſe the moſt ſtrict imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality with our ſelves, and the greateſt Charity to others.</p>
                  <p>Yet our Adverſaries glory in nothing more then in the name of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and boaſt in no Title ſo much as that of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which hath had deſervedly ſo great veneration in all Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>But their claim here truly examined will prove as fallacious and arrogant as in any other inſtance. For the term <hi>Catholick</hi> if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the notation of the word, or the moſt conſtant uſe of it, is the ſame as <hi>

But what that holy Father every where preſſeth upon them reacheth as nearly our Antagoniſts; the indiſpenſable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Charity, that great bond of Unity in the Church, and principal evidence of the Divine Spirit, which animates the whole, without
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98824:75"/> which the higheſt gifts, and moſt Sacred Miniſtrations are rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. This is one of the prime characteriſtick notes of the true Catholick Church, and every living Member thereof, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more oppoſit to their Principles and Practices, who have formally excluded all other chriſtians and churches from any ſhare therein, not only thoſe in the Weſt, that have deſervedly caſt off that Power, which they had unjuſtly arrogated, and tyrannical exerciſed, but alſo the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and others in the Eaſt, that never owned any ſubjection to them.</p>

We may conſult the tendency of lapſ'd mankind, In the beſt how weak it is, and apt to be impoſed on; In others how prone to corrupt, and diſtort the beſt Inſtitutions, caſt a miſt before the cleareſt diſcoveries, and offer violence to the ſtrongeſt convictions to ſhelter their vices, and promote their unwarrantable intereſts, eſpecially in times of eaſe, plenty, and outward proſperity. In which we may compare common experience in leſſer Societies, which however wiſely directed at firſt, regularly founded, and ſtrongly guarded on all ſides, without a very careful Inſpection, and ſometimes vigorus oppoſition, ſo many corruptions will creep in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98824:76"/> as to need frequent reformations to reduce them back to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Conſtitution. And although an eſpecial providence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the guard and conduct of Gods Church, yet neither Scripture, nor experience warrant us to expect its happy Influence by miracles now, for the effecting of that which may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the uſe of ordinary and regular means of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We may reflect upon the particular Ages of the Church, which we charge eſpecially with theſe defections from about the eight century to the Reformation, wherein if all or moſt of them did not come in, yet they grew to that extravagant height, as to gain eſtabliſhment for Principles of Chriſtianity. Theſe Ages are charged by their own Authors, as well as ours, and ſtand moſt ſenſibly convict of the groſſeſt Barbariſm, Stupidity, Ignorance, depraved Manners, and all ſuch corrupt Inclinations in all Orders and Degrees, eſpecially the ruling part, as were moſt likely to make way for ſuch changes, and Innovations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We have ſome farther ſenſible proof of a deſign in many within that time to impoſe upon the credulity of others, and bring in ſtrange Doctrines, and unwarrantable Practices, by the many Fabulous Stories, feigned Apparitions, and Revelations, ſeveral of which they themſelves will hardly now defend, then brought into the Church to confirm theſe points in difference, and which almoſt only the people then received for their Inſtructions, to entice them firſt into an awful opinion of, and then a confident relyance upon theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Nay farther, among the many ſpurious Writings which then crept into the World under the moſt venerable names of the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fathers of the Church, now moſtly diſcarded by themſelves, when their ſhameleſs Impudence hath been ſo full expoſed, yet few of them there are in which this contrivance is not legible throughout to advance theſe Opinions, and Practices. So that we are indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Reformation, thoſe great men which laboured in it, and ſome of the moſt moderate and learned of their own ſide, with the Art of Printing then newly found out, that almoſt all Ancient Authors, and Records have not loſt their Authority, which would have been much endangered among ſuch groſs depravers of Antiquity, whoſe conſtant buſineſs it was to mar good Authors by their Interpolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Additions, or Subſtractions: or vent new ones under coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit old names to ſerve corrupt ends. But we are ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to their ignorance, and ſtupidity, for doing it ſo groſly that there was need of little skill or obſervation to diſcover their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To which may be added in the laſt place againſt the ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98824:77"/> preſumption in private perſons, or particular Churches to judge of publick Eſtabliſhments by a ſeeming Superiour Authority: that without ſome judgement of diſcretion in the former there is no room for a proper Moral Act, much leſs are they capable of a truely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Obligation, which an abſolute implicite faith perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes. But whilſt every man is bound to prove his own work, and muſt bear his own burden, he muſt examine the grounds of his aſſent according to his capacity, and determine himſelf by the beſt motives he can procure, and is concerned at his utmoſt peril to do it with all due reſpect to the Authority and Judgement of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, as well as the evidence of the things themſelves, which are no where in any Government beſide thought inconſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations duly weighed may obviate thoſe firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which uſually lie in the way to intercept all thoughts of farther trial, and examination of particular points in controverſie, and may ſilence or ſhame the late idle vaunts of ſuch who pretend to reaſon us out of our ſenſes and undertake to demonſtrate it <hi>á priori</hi> impoſſible that ever any falſe opinion ſhould get into the Church, or prevail therein. <hi>I</hi> wiſh theſe men would try their pains, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty to prove it impoſſible there could be any ſuch thing as wilful ſin in the world.

But after the moſt artificial compoſures herein they would hardly believe themſelves or be credited by others againſt their experience.

                  <p>2. When this ſeemingly prevailed, and a pretended Council was called, it was far from being free or general. The Italian and mere titular Biſhops outnumbred all the reſt, and both one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were overawed by the Popes immediate Dependants or Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and all things carried by ſuch ſtratagems of Policy, or partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of intereſt that the only care taken was to fix the diſeaſe, and not provide for the cure by the beſt account we have of thoſe tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that ſome Princes of their own communion entred their Proteſtations againſt its proceedings, diſowning any Obligation to be tied up to their determinations.</p>

While the Roman Empire was intire, the Emperours Edict alone was Summons ſufficient to almoſt the whole Chriſtian Church. But now who ſhall take upon him to call or invite ſo many from ſo diſtant places no way under his Authority? And that the Pope ever pretended to this power till of late can ſcarce be pleaded againſt ſuch clear evidences, and Examples; and where he is ſo much concerned, it will be judged more unreaſonable for him to demand it, If this difficulty were overcome by any conſent, or condeſcenſion: yet ſo many jealouſies, and croſs intereſts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that will be, and have been laid in the way of their firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with a requiſite peaceable diſpoſition, as are not eaſily foreſeen, and leſs readily governed; not to interpoſe the difficulties of the journeys from ſuch diſtant places, and of the diſcontinuance ſo long from home of the chief Governours of the Church: many doubts and controverſies of the number, and quality of perſons having right to vote therein by themſelves, or repreſentatives will not ſoon be adjuſted, and without theſe and ſuch like be determined there is no preparation made for ſo venerable an Aſſembly.</p>

                  <p>Whoever ſeriouſly reflects upon theſe things will have little reaſon to quarrel at the Reformation for want of this formal eſtabliſhment in Council.</p>
                  <p>No Chriſtian, or Church is chargeable with the lack of that which is not in their power to procure. Men may pleaſe themſelves with remote Speculations, and the faireſt hopes, and wiſhes of ſuch an Authoritative Deciſion of the diſputes in controverſie: but if it be not to be had, we muſt reſt content with, and make the beſt uſe we can of that proviſion which GOD in mercy hath indulged us for our ſufficient ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Every particular National Church directly ſubject to no other may, and ought to reform it ſelf from known Abuſes: keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Rule of GODS Word, avoiding as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible giving juſt offence to any beſide, and being ready to give an account of its proceedings therein to all, and to alter any thing that ſhall be found amiſs, or add whatever may be proved wanting, to receive others into its Communion, and to communicate with them ſo far as may be conſiſtent with common Chriſtianity owned by all, endeavouring to preſerve Peace, and Unity, with all that call upon the ſame LORD, praying to GOD to increaſe, and improve them more and more; ſuch hath been the continued aim, and proceeding of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Our Enemies on both ſides are apt to object to us the want of due Diſcipline, if not abſolutely neceſſary to the being of the Church, yet ſo far uſeful to the well-being, and perfection of it, that it ought to have great weight in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining our choice to one Communion, before another, and is one of the moſt ſenſible bands of Unity in the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The reſtauration of the Primitive Vigour of this hath been alwayes wiſhed for by our Church, as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Commination, but the accompliſhment is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</p>
                  <p>From the degeneracy of the Age, which would hardly bear it. He that Governs in a leſs Sphere will find how oft he muſt bear with things, which he does not approve: and much eaſier it is to find fault with, then to amend what ſometimes we know to be amiſs.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98824:79"/>
                  <p>From the multiplicity of Diviſions, which weaken all endeavours towards it, and then froward men unworthily charge the Church with what they themſelves make almoſt unavoidable; whereas, if executed, it would reach themſelves as nearly as any who are now ſo clamorous againſt the moſt tender, and charitable endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it as cruel and inhumane.</p>
                  <p>2. The Pretences to it in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> according to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice, ſo far as it can appear to us, and we can judge by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, are more dangerous then any of theſe Omiſſions, when turn'd into a conſtant circle of ſinning, private Confeſſion, and Prieſtly Abſolution upon the impoſition of very inſignificant Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſo over again. For hereby men have the Authority of their Church to confirm in them the dangerous preſumption that they have thus readily cleared themſelves before GOD, and ſo ſoon perfected their Repentance for ſuch Sins, which we find them not ſo watchfull againſt afterwards, as that ought to ſuppoſe, or make them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> commands private Confeſſion for our clearer ſatisfaction, and direction in difficult caſes as moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: but cannot truly ſay that it is an indiſpenſable condition of our pardon, which was never ſo believed, or practiſed in the church for many Centuries. If people will not be perſwaded to their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, unleſs they be forced to it by falſe denounciations, they muſt look to that; if they miſcarry it lies at their own door, while they have no hopes here given them of pardon, but upon ſuch an intire Repentance as deſtroyes the habit of ſin, and plants the contrary Grace; and what need they may have of the Aſſiſtance of a Spiritual Guide, and other helps in many caſes in order to this effect, they may beſt conſider.</p>
                  <p>3. However the due adminiſtration of Diſcipline is to be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong conveniencies, and advantages to be wiſh'd for, rather then neceſſaries we cannot be without; and it hath been, and will be in all Ages of the church more or leſs perfect according to a great many contingencies not to be ſtated before hand. The church hath ever judg'd it the beſt meaſure of uſing it ſo as may moſt ſerve the ends of Religion, and the general benefit of the community, and not that ſhe is bound alwayes up to the ſtrict merit of the perſons falling under it; and yet after all the ſtricteſt care, and impartiality there will be room for the final Separation, when our LORD ſhall ſend his Angels to gather out of his own Kingdom all offences, and them which do iniquity. If we will ſhun all communication with theſe, though only in what is good, we muſt flie out of any church that ever yet was, or will be, ſo far as we know, in this World, and ſo from any hopes in that to come: yet ſcarce any conſiderable Schiſm hath
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98824:79"/> appeared in the Church, which did not ſhelter it ſelf under this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>4. Father it may be alledged that ſeveral reſtraints may be upon the Church from the Civil Power. When this had ſuffered ſo much by former Encroachments, and Uſurpations no wonder if it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome jealouſie of that Yoke which with ſo much difficulty it caſt off, and provide as ſecurely as it can for its future preſervation, though by ſuſpending ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e of that outward aſſiſtance very conduceable to the due effect of Church cenſures, and ſometimes by putting a ſtop to their ſenſible progreſs, in ſome caſes where no ſuch danger or neceſſity required it. Men by miſtakes, or prejudice may ſtrain each power too far. Better experience of the Regular management of the Eccleſiaſtical, may in due time encourage the Secular farther to enlarge their Liberty, and encourage their proceedings ſo as may be moſt ſubſervient to the ends of true Religion, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the common ſecurity of Church and State, All the power which the Church pretends to as ſuch, is ſpiritual, and that can make no alteration in the Civil Rights of men.</p>
                  <p>5. Yet after all, the Church amongſt us hath not only ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority committed to her by CHRIST; but reſerved, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the Laws of the Land to teſtifie her Abhorrence of all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Scandals, to the ſhame, and confuſion of groſs Offenders, and as a direful earneſt of a worſe doom that awaits them hereafter, not here prevented by a ſatisfactory Repentance. <hi>I</hi> need not refer to particular inſtances when we have frequent examples thereof. If this be not alwayes exerciſed by thoſe with whom it is entruſted with all due vigour, and ſincerity, after juſt abatement for neceſſity and a favourable allowance for ſuch perplext difficulties, of which ſcarce any private perſon can make a fair and competent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fault will lie only at their doors whoſe is the neglect, and private Chriſtians ſhall not fare the worſe in the performance of their duty, nor fail of the ſalutary effects of the ordinary means of Grace by GODS own appointment, becauſe every publick mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is not performed with that Religious care which becomes ſuch concerns.</p>
                  <p>6. Little pretence can they have from this Objection that deſert the Eſtabliſh'd National Church, and that moſt advantagious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bond of Unity therein, in purſuit of private Aſſemblies, and ſelect Congregations, where all acts of Diſcipline muſt needs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Arbitrary on one ſide, and precarious on the other. When he or they who inflict them own no power over them to aw, or direct their proceeding, or upon juſt occaſion ro reverſe their Sentence; nor he who falls under them has any other engagement to ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then his own free Act, nor can ſuffer any farther
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98824:80"/>prejudice without it, then to be forced it may be to change his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or place of meeting. What ever grave, and ſolemn appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance this may carry at the firſt ſetting up of ſuch a new Government, it will ſoon degenerate into Mockery, or Confuſion, Whatſoever deſtroyes the Unity of the Church overturns the main ſtrength, and Foundation of all Diſcipline; the defects hereof we may hope to ſee repaired with the preſervation of that, but without that no proſpect appears of any overtures towards it.</p>
                  <p>7. To which may be added in the laſt place, whatever want of Diſcipline any may lay to the charge of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none can complain of her breach of that Unity therein, which all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches ought to maintain. She neither invades the Rights, nor pretends to reverſe the juſt and regular Cenſures, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances the Schiſmaticks, nor diſallows the miniſtrations of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church ſo far as conſiſtent with the expreſs Inſtitutions of our bleſſed Saviour; and the univerſally received practice of his Church, though otherwiſe mix'd with ſeveral corruptions which ſhe wiſhes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>

Laſtly, our Roman Adverſaries object to us the many obſtinate Schiſms, and groſs Hereſies, which have ſprung up ſince the Reformation, and as they pretend out of it, from the forſaking of that bond of Unity in the Catholick Church, only to be hoped for in their Communion, where alone they ſay theſe are prevented, or ſoon cured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt part of matter of fact is too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and too ſcandalous to be defended: but againſt the latter part of the original of theſe Schiſms, and Hereſies many juſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be interpoſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Reformation gives no countenance to them, but ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemns them, and provides ſufficient means to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; if notwithſtanding wicked men of corrupt Principles, and depraved manners flee hither for ſhelter to hide their enormities, and abuſe or pervert the moſt wholſom Inſtitutions, and advantagious opportunities for their ſpiritual proficiency to the moſt contrary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; The guilt and ill conſequence will lie only at their own doors. Chriſtians muſt not debarred of the ordinary means of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome turn this Grace into wantonneſs. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of ſome who wreſt the Scriptures unto their own deſtruction; but neither he nor any other then, or for many Ages after thought this motive ſufficient to deprive the People of the uſe of them, made it rather an argument of conſulting them with greater caution and and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, leſt being led away with the errrour of the wicked they fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There were many Schiſms and Hereſies ſprung up in the firſt and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98824:80"/> beſt Ages of the Church, even in the times of the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as appears by ſeveral intimations in their Writings, and in the immediatly ſucceeding, while many Apoſtolical men were living, and if we compare the account we have of them in the moſt ancient Authors, particularly in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> they were as wild, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as any of the later date: yet the Apologiſts for true Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thought themſelves very injuriouſly charged with thoſe blaſphemous Principles, or flagitious Practices which they wholly renounced, or diſowned.

Phrenſical Opinions, and all manner of looſeneſs in Principles, and Practices came in like a torrent, and overſpread the Land, which before skulkt in corners, and were little taken notice of. The Reſtitution of the church hath in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure put a ſtop to their progreſs; I know not of any Sect, which hath ſtarted up ſince that time: But almoſt every year before brought forth ſeveral. If her pains and care have not yet been ſo ſucceſsfully prevalent as to recover, and reſtore all that have gone aſtray, ſhe hath not been wanting in her endeavours towards it, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many; and it is no little time, nor eaſie task to repair the the Ruines of ſuch long confuſions, and Deſolations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We owe a great part of theſe calamities to the ſame perſons, who now charge them upon us; for beſide the influence with their Agents, Principles, and Examples had his contriving and promoting

For when Mens minds are unſettled, and they grown giddy with being long turned about by every new wind of Doctrine, and are weary of tumbling and toſſing from one Party to another, they will eaſily catch hold of any fancied ſupport, and be ſooner betrayed to yield themſelves captives to the deluſory hopes of reſt and ſettlement amongſt them.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98824:82"/> The caſe hath been too like exemplified in another Inſtance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late years, in which many Hypocrites have ſo ſcandalouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed the moſt ſolemn pretences to Sanctity and Devotion for a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or continuance to the moſt horrid Opreſſions, Schiſms, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, that they have emboldned profane men to ſcorn, and ſend out open Defiances againſt the very appearance of Religion, and poſſibly tempted others ſerious, and hearty lovers of its cauſe to be too modeſt, and ſhamefaced in its defence: yet we hope unfeigned Piety will be alwayes juſtified of its Children.

                  <p>Experience, and farther conſideration may have made all prudent and ſober Friends to true Piety, Vertue, and good Order aſhamed of the popular Plea of Liberty, or that men ought to be left free from any reſtraint, or Impoſitions in matters of Religion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; which muſt needs confound all peace, and overturn all Government in every Society, and ſo deſtroy the being of the Church as ſuch, and expoſe private perſons to all manner of ſtrange delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and extravagant enterpriſes without the leaſt guard or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; beſide the ill aſpect it hath on the Civil Peace; I may add, It never was, and I doubt never will be practiſed by any Party of men, when they can do otherwiſe, who flee to it only for Sanctuary when they can find ſhelter no where beſide. Would men but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially look abroad, or conſult former times, or but really conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what were like to be their ſtate under any other ſettled Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by whatever favourable Character it may have been repreſented, they might find little temptation to querulous uneaſineſs in their preſent condition, and ſmall encouragement to ſeek, and improve every occaſion to quarrel at thoſe few, and mild reſtraints laid on them eſpecially if withall they would faithfully reflect upon the ill uſe which hath been made of more remiſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Chriſtianity, which is the Goſpel of Love, and Peace, and is almoſt wholly made up of Charity; inclines us firſt, and moſt, to the mildeſt methods, as moſt grateful, moſt likely to win upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens good affections, and to teſtifie our own. But then this mildneſs may be turned into the greateſt cruelty to the guilty as well as to the innocent, yea, to the whole Community. Our great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be ſo to purſue the former as we may avoid the latter,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98824:83"/> and I know not where it is done more cautiouſly then here.</p>
                  <p>If we were to examine the ſtrange and ſtiff Averſations in many to the Communion of our Church, we ſtill find them moſtly owing to blind prejudice, and groſs Ignorance of what is required of them, more then to any other principles. They have been brought up in a very ill opinion of our Service meerly by odious names, ſly and invidious Characters given to it from perſons whoſe ſincerity and judgment they rely on, and ſo are before reſolved againſt any farther inquiry, and induſtriouſly ſhun all opportunities of better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either by perſonal Conference, or reading our Books. They think themſelves ſufficiently ſatisfied, and go on to hate and revile, but they often know not what, nor why. If we could bring them to make their own trial, who are alwayes jealous of any attempts from us, matter of fact would be their confutation, and their own Eyes and Ears prove their moſt effectual conviction, ſo as to wonder at their former obſtinacy, which ſome of them have confeſſed upon this experience. I believe were ſome fierce Diſſenters ask'd, they can ſcarce ſay, that they ever ſeriouſly read, or attentively heard the Liturgy, and know very little what it is therein which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them; I am ſure they will hardly tell us. Sometimes meer novelty ſtartles them, and they are afraid only for not being uſed to it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and many little Objections, that we can ſcarce gueſs at would ſoon be removed by this ſenſible proof reach'd down to all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; and a ſober, ſteddy temper of mind, with a firm, and well grounded belief in moſt of the material Points of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, variouſly inculcated in the ſeveral Offices of our Liturgy, would grow up more and more in them; for want of this we find in ſeveral Zealots very little knowledge of the firſt Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and indeed very little to be learn'd from thoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſcourſes and Phraſes to which they have been hitherto uſed. But more particularly may theſe Reflections be applied to invite the Romaniſts amongſt us unto the free, ſincere, and cordial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which once, though only to outward appearance, they generally obſerved, and have almoſt nothing to object againſt it but the raſh, and Schiſmatical Interdict of a forrein uſurped Power. That the terms of our communion are moſt truly Catholick hath been the chief deſign of this ſmall Tractat to prove, and thereby to prevent the common prejudice from the name of the Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church, in which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they aſſume to themſelves, we have as good a tittle to our ſhare as any Church in the world. And no ſenſible evidence have we of our Communion with that Catholick Church, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the more particular Church in which Divine
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98824:83"/> Providence hath placed us, where nothing is required of us repugnant to the Bond of Unity in the whole.</p>
                  <p>Many of our Church, yea, our Conſtitution it ſelf have been often charged, and reviled, though moſt unjuſtly, with too favourable an inclination to them of <hi>Rome:</hi> becauſe whatever of good Order, and decent Solemnity, as well as ſound Doctrine, and wholſome Inſtruction was ſound among them, is ſtill retained and cheriſhed by us. And that we are not ſo haſty and peremptory in unchurching them all together, or damning preſently all that have been, or are ſtill of their communion, as ſome would have us: which is in effect for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more tender in preſerving the principles of true Catholick Unity then in pleaſing private humours or prejudices.</p>
                  <p>Still we muſt be aware that no pretended Charity to them, nor yet compliance with thoſe who pretend the greateſt oppoſition to them muſt tempt us to betray the Truth of GOD, or violate our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his commands on either ſide; and within thoſe bounds to conſult, as much as poſſible, the Peace and Unity of his church, and continue therein. If the former retort our kindneſs upon us in new Oppoſitions: If the latter load our religious care and modeſt cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all thoſe dreadful imputations due to others: If we ſuffer from both beſides, whilſt it is only for ſpeaking the Truth, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Duty, which we have no power to alter; we may juſtifie our ſelves before God, and our own Conſciences, and in due time with all good reaſonable, and conſiderative men, and then it is no matter what the clamours, and captious cavils of others lay upon us.</p>

                  <p>Whatſoever were the condition of thoſe who lived in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion before the Reformation, many of them groaned under thoſe Oppreſſions from which we are happily freed: nay, whatever chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table allowance may ſtill be made for them, who now live within thoſe Boundaries where they have little opportunity of knowing

                  <p>As for thoſe born, and bred among us, who have been treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deluded into Apoſtacy from us, or will perſiſt in their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary obſtinate averſeneſs to us againſt the Cleareſt conviction, which they may receive, and in oppoſition to the expreſs Laws of GOD, and of the Land, to the perpetual diſturbance of the State, and confuſion of the Church; there appears no room for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to leſſen their Crime, or alleviate their doom, which will be mightly encreaſed, when all manner of hidden and crafty Artifices, or open violence againſt the common Rights of Humane Society, and moral Honeſty, as well as the Faith, and Charity of Chriſts Church are imployed, and conſecrated into a religious but blind Zeal for the deſtruction of both.</p>
                  <p>No marvel if the Nation awakened with the effects hereof, which it hath ſometimes felt, and oftner had reaſon to fear, have provided ſome ſevere Laws for an aw over them, and to ſtop the firſt beginnings of ſuch exorbitant attempts, ready to break through all ordinary incloſures, and which will hardly be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the uſual methods of Government.

If we be in the right, the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is guilty of giving worſhip to Creatures which is due to GOD alone; which is acknowledged on all hands to be the greateſt of ſins; and therefore this is a diſpue which can never be compromiſed, though we were never ſo deſirous of an union and reconciliation with the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>for the Incommunicable glory of GOD and the ſalvation of our Souls, are too dear things to be given away in complement to any Church.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>TO make good the firſt point, that we muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> no other being, but only GOD, I ſhall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally confine my ſelf to Scripture evidence, which is the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain authority to determine this matter, For though I confeſs, it ſeems to me a ſelf evident and fundamental principle in natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that we muſt worſhip none but that Supreme Beeing, who made, and who governs the World, yet I find men reaſon very differently about theſe matters.</p>
                     <p>The Heathen Philoſophers, who generally acknowledge one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Soveraign Deity, did not think it incongruous, nor any affront or dimimition to the Supreme God, to aſcribe an inferiour kind of Divinity, nor to pay an inferiour degree of Religious Worſhip to thoſe excellent Spirits, which are ſo much above us, and have ſo great a ſhare in the government of this lower world, no more then it is an affront to a Soveraign Monarch, to honour and reverence his great Miniſters of State, or peculiar Favourites. And the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhe has corrupted Chriſtianity with the worſhip of Angels, and Saints departed, ſo ſhe defends her ſelf with the ſame Arguments and reaſons, which were long ſince alledged by <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and other Heathen Philoſophers, in defence of their Pagan Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>And it muſt be confeſt, that theſe Arguments are very popular, and have ſomething ſo agreeable in them, to the natural notions of Civil Honour and reſpect, which admits of great variety of degrees, that <hi>I</hi> do not wonder that ſuch vaſt numbers of men, both wiſe and unwiſe, have been impoſed on by them.</p>
                     <p>For there is certainly a proportionable reverence and reſpect due even to created excellencies, and every degree of power challenges and commands a juſt regard, and we are bound to be very thankful not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to GOD who is the firſt cauſe, and the ſupreme giver of all good things, but to our immediate Benefactors alſo. And therefore if there be a ſort of middle Beeings, as the Heathens believed, and as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſerts, between us and the Supreme God, who take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care of us, and either by their power and intereſt in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, or by their Interceſſions with the Supreme GOD, can and do beſtow a great many Bleſſings on us, it eems as natural
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98824:87"/> and neceſſary to fear and reverence, to honour and worſhip, them, and to give them thanks for their care and patronage of us, as it is to court a powerful Favourite, who by his intereſt and authority can obtain any requeſt we make to our Prince; and the firſt ſeems to be no greater injury to God, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">2. Col. 18.</note> to a Prince. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, that there is a ſhew of humility in worſhipping Angels; that men dare not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately approach ſo glorious a Majeſty as God is, but make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to thoſe excellent ſpirits which attend the Throne of God, and are the Miniſters of his Providence.</p>
                     <p>But then every one who believes that there is one Supreme God, who made all other Beeings, though never ſo perfect and excellent, muſt acknowledge, that as there is nothing common to God and Creatures, ſo there muſt be a particular Worſhip due to God, which no Creatures can challenge any ſhare in. It is no affront to a Prince to pay ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degrees of civil honour and reſpect to his Miniſters and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, becauſe as the difference between a Prince and his ſubjects is not founded in nature, but in civil order; ſo there are different degrees of civil reſpect proportioned to the different ranks and degrees of men in the Common-wealth. There is a degree of preheminency which is ſacred and peculiar to the Perſon of the Prince, and no Prince will ſuffer his greateſt Favourite to uſurp the Prerogative honours which belong to the Crown; but while they are contented with ſuch reſpects as are due to their rank and ſtation, this is no injury to the Prince; for all civil honour is not peculiar to the Prince, but only a ſupereminent degree of it, and therefore inferiour degrees of honour may be given to other perſons.</p>
                     <p>But though there are different degrees of civil honour proper to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ranks and degrees of men, who all partake in the ſame nature, and are diſtinguiſht only by their different places in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; yet in this ſenſe there are no different degrees of Religious Worſhip, All Religious Worſhip is peculiar to the Divine Nature, which is but one, and common only to three Divine Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, one God bleſſed for ever, Amen. Civil ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Religious Worſhip differ in the whole kind and ſpecies of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have as different objects as God and Creatures; and we may as well argue from thoſe different degrees of civil honour among men, to prove that there is an inferiour degree of civil honour due to beaſts, as that there is an inferiour degree of Religious Worſhip due to ſome men. For all degrees of Religious Worſhip are as peculiar and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to God, as civil reſpects are to men, and as the higheſt degree of civil honour is to a Soveraign Prince.</p>
                     <p>However ſhould we grant, that ſome excellent Creatures might be capable of ſome inferiour degrees of Religious Worſhip; yet as the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98824:87"/> Prince is the fountain of civil honour, which no ſubject muſt preſume to uſurp, without a grant from his Prince; ſo no creature, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoever; has any natural and inherent right to any degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, and therefore we muſt not preſume to worſhip any Creature without Gods command, nor to pay any other degree of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to them, but what God hath preſcribed and inſtituted; and the only way to know this, is to examine the Scriptures, which is the only external revelation we have of the will of God.</p>
                     <p>Let us then inquire, what the ſenſe of Scripture is in this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and I ſhall diſtinctly examine the teſtimonies both of the Old and New Teſtament, concerning the object of Religious Worſhip.</p>

                     <p>1.

It is written,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 10. Deut. 6. 13. Deutr 10. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord they God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, from whence our Saviour cites this Law, it is only ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him,</hi> without that addition, <hi>of him only.</hi> And yet both the Septuagint and the vulgar Latine, read the words as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth, <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> and the authority of our Saviour is ſufficient to juſtifie this Interpretation; and withal, gives us a general rule, which puts an end to this controverſie; that as often as we are commanded in Scripture to worſhip God, we are commanded alſo to worſhip none beſides him.</p>
                     <p>For indeed the firſt Commandment is very expreſs in this matter, and all other Laws which concern the obiect of Worſhip, muſt in all reaſon be expounded by that. <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before me.</hi> The Septuagint <note place="margin">20 Exod. 3.</note> renders it <hi>plen emu</hi> beſides me; ſo does the <hi>Chaldee, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> to the ſame ſenſe. And it is univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by all Expoſitors that I have ſeen, that the true interpretation of this Commandment is, that we muſt worſhip no other God, but the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> To pay Religious Worſhip to any Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98824:88"/> does in the Scriptures notion, make that Beeing our God, which is the only reaſon, why they are commanded not <hi>to have any other Gods.</hi> For there is but one true God; and therefore in a ſtrict ſenſe, they can have no other GODS, becauſe there are no other Gods to be had; but whatever Beeings they worſhip, they make that their God by worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and ſo the Heathens had a great many Gods, but the <hi>Jews</hi> are commanded to have but one GOD, that is, to worſhip none elſe beſides him.</p>
                     <p>In other places GOD expreſly forbids them to worſhip any <hi>ſtrange Gods, or the Gods of the people, or thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 14</note> 
                        <hi>that were round about them.</hi> And leaſt we ſhould ſuſpect, that they were forbid to worſhip the Gods of the people, only becauſe thoſe Heathen Idolaters worſhip Devils, and wicked Spirits, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gives us a general notion, who are to be reputed falſe GODS, and not to be worſhipped. <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay unto them, the Gods that have not made the Heavens and the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Heavens.</hi> So that whatever Beeing is worſhipped, whither it be a good or a bad Spirit, which did not make the Heavens and the Earth, is a falſe GOD to ſuch Worſhippers: and I ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not ſay, that Saints or Angels, or the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (as much as they magnifie her) made the Heavens and the Earth, And then according to this rule they ought not to be worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>But to put this paſt doubt, that the true meaning of theſe Laws is to forbid the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides the Supreme GOD, I ſhall obſerve two or three things in our Saviours anſwer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils temptation which will give great light and ſtrength to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That our Saviour abſolutely rejects the worſhip of any other Beeing together with the Supreme GOD. The thing our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, is not the renouncing the worſhip of God for the worſhip of Creatures, (for the Devil never tempted him to his) but the worſhip of any other being beſides GOD, though we ſtill continue to worſhip the Supreme GOD. <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Which is a plain demonſtration, that men may believe and worſhip the Supreme God, and yet be Idolaters, if they worſhip any thing elſe beſides him. The Devil did not deſire our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to renounce the worſhip of the ſupreme God, but was contented, that he ſhould worſhip God ſtill, ſo he would but worſhip him alſo. And therefore it is no reaſon to excuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Idolatry, becauſe they worſhip the ſupreme God, as well as Saints and Angels: this they may do, and be Idolaters ſtill; for Idolatry does not conſiſt meerly in renouncing the worſhip of the ſupreme God, but in worſhipping any thing elſe, though we continue to worſhip
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98824:88"/> him. When the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhip'd their <hi>Baalims</hi> and falſe gods, they did not wholly renounce the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves, eſpecially the wiſeſt men amongſt them, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one ſupreme God, though they worſhiped a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Deities with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our Saviour in his anſwer to the Devils temptation, does not urge his being a wicked and Apoſtate Spirit, an enemy and a rebel againſt God, but gives ſuch a reaſon why he could not worſhip him, as equally excludes all Creatures, whither good or bad Spirits, from any right to Divine Worſhip, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Him and none elſe, whither they be good or bad ſpirits, for our Saviour does not confine his anſwer to either, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore includes them both.</p>
                     <p>When we charge the church of <hi>Rome</hi> with too plain an imitation of the Pagan Idolatry in that worſhip they paid to their inferiour Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was nothing more, then what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now gives to Saints and Angels; they think it a ſufficient anſwer, that the Heathens worſhiped Devils and Apoſtate Spirits, but they worſhip only the Friends and Favourites of God, bleſſed Saints and Angels.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhall not at preſent examine the truth of this pretence, but ſhal refer my Reader to a more Learned <note place="margin">Stillingfleet's <hi>Defence of the diſcourſe of Idolatry.</hi>
                        </note> perſon for ſatisfaction in this matter, but if it were true, yet it is nothing to the purpoſe, if our Saviours anſwer to the Devil be good.</p>
                     <p>For let us ſuppoſe, that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who calls himſelf Chriſts Vicar, had at this time been in Chriſt's ſtead to have anſwered the Devils temptations, and let us be ſo charitable for once as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that (ſaving alwayes his indirect power over the Kingdoms of this world <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia)</hi> he would not worſhip the Devil to gain all the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them. Conſider then, how the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> could anſwer this Temptation; <hi>All this I will give the, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> could he anſwer as our Saviour does? <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> How eaſily might the Devil reply, Is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed your infallible Opinion; and the judgment and practice of your Church <hi>to ſerve God only?</hi> do you not alſo ſerve and worſhip St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> beſides a great many other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtfull Saints? This is down right Hereſie to confine all Religious Worſhip to God; Here now is matter of fact againſt the Pope, that he does worſhip other Beeings beſide God, and if he will ſhew any reaſon for his not worſhipping the Devil; he muſt quite alter our Saviours anſwer, and not plead for himſelf, that he is bound to worſhip God and him only, but that he is bound to worſhip
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98824:89"/> only God and good Spirits; and therefore the Devil being a wicked and Apoſtat Spirit, it is not lawful to worſhip him. So that if our Savior gave a ſufficient anſwer to the Devils temptation, it muſt be equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to worſhip good and bad ſpirits; there may be ſome peculiar aggravations in having communion with Devils, but the Idolatry of worſhipping good and bad ſpirits is the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our Saviours anſwer to the Devil, appropriates all kinds and degrees of Religious Worſhip to God alone. The Devil was not then ſo good a School-man, as nicely to diſtinguiſh and diſpute the degrees of Religious Worſhip with our Saviour, but would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with any degree of Religious Worſhip. He did not pretend to be the Supreme God, nor to have the diſpoſal of all the Kingdoms of the World in his own right: <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 6.</note> but acknowledges, that <hi>it was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him,</hi> and now by vertue of that grant, <hi>he gives it to whom he will.</hi> Now it is impoſſible in the nature of the thing to worſhip any Beeing as Supreme: whom at the ſame time, we acknowledge not to be Supreme, And therefore the Devil asks no more of our Saviours, then that <hi>he would fall down and worſhip him;</hi> which is ſuch an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour degree of Worſhip, as Papiſts every day pay to Images and Saints, and yet this our Saviour refuſes to do, and that for this reaſon that we muſt worſhip God only, which muſt ſignifie, that we muſt not give the leaſt degree of divine Worſhip to any Creatures; or elſe it is not a ſatisfactory anſwer to the Devils Temptation, who did not require any certain and determinate degree of worſhip, but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>11. As the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> in general, appropriate all Religious Worſhip to God, commands us to worſhip God and him only, ſo the whole Jewiſh Religion was fitted only for the worſhip of the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe our Adverſaries will not deny, that the Tabernacle and Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was peculiarly conſecrated to the honour and worſhip of the Lord Jehovah: this was the houſe where he dwelt, where he plac'd his Name: and the Symbols of his preſence. It was a great profanation of that holy place, to have the worſhip of any ſtrange Gods ſet up in it; and yet this was the only place of Worſhip appointed by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and they had but one Temple to worſhip in, and this one Temple conſecrated to the particular worſhip of one God; which is a plain demonſtration, that they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to worſhip any other God, becauſe they had no place to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in.</p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:98824:89"/>
                     <p>And this I think is a plain proof, that all that worſhip which was confined to their Temple, or related to it, was peculiar to the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> becauſe that was his houſe, and then all the Jewiſh worſhip was ſo, which was either to be performed at the Temple, or had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and dependance on the Temple worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Sacrifice was the principle part of the Jewiſh worſhip, and this we know was confined to the Temple. <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Iſrael, take head to thy ſelf, that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 12. 13. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeeſt. But in the place which the Lord ſhall chooſe in one of thy Tribes, there ſhalt thou offer thy burnt offerings; and there ſhalt thou do all that I command thee.</hi> The Prophets indeed, eſpecially before the building of the Temple, did erect Altars at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places for occaſional Sacrifices, for as God reſerved a liberty to himſelf to diſpenſe with his own Law in extraordinary caſes, ſo it was preſumed, that what was done by Prophets was done by a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but there was to be no ordinary or ſtanding Altar for Sacrifice but at the Tabernacle or Temple; this we may ſee in that diſpute which had like to have hapned between the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Tribes of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> about the Altar of Teſtimony, which theſe two <note place="margin">Joſhua 22.</note> Tribes and a half built on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan.</hi> It was agreed on all hands, that it had been intended for an Altar for Sacrifice, it had been Rebellion againſt the Lord to have built any Altar beſide the Altar of the <note place="margin">v. 16, 19. 22, 23.</note> Lord, though they had offered no Sacrifice but to the Lord Jehovah. The ſame is evident from Gods diſlike of their offering Sacrifices in their high places, though they ſacrificed only to the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that all Sacrifices were to be offered at the Temple on the Altar of God, and therefore were offered only to that God, whoſe Altar and Temple it was. And indeed this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly provided for in the Law. <hi>He that ſacrificeth to any God, but to the Lord only, ſhall be utterly deſtroyed.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 20.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as their Sacrifices were appropriated to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo in ſome ſenſe were their Prayers, which were offered up in vertue of their Sacrifice. And therefore <note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 7. Mat. 21. 13. 1 King. 8.</note> this is a peculiar name for the Temple, that it was <hi>the Houſe of Prayer.</hi> Here GOD was more immediately preſent to hear thoſe Prayers which were offered to him according to <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer at the Dedication of the Temple. It is true, the devout <hi>Jews</hi> did pray to God where ever they were, though at a great diſtance from the Temple, whither in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or out of it, but then there are two things, which ſhew
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98824:90"/> that relation their prayers had to the Temple Worſhip. 1. That their ſtated hours of prayer were the hours of Sacrifice, which plainly ſignified, that they offered up their Prayers in conjunction with thoſe Sacrifices, which were at that time offered in the Temple; and therefore that they prayed only to that GOD to whom they ſacrified; for we muſt conſider, that the conſtant morning and evening Sacrifices, were not particular ſacrifices, but were offered for the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and therefore every man had a ſhare in them. Hence the time of offering the Sacrifice, is called the hour of Prayer. Thus <hi>Peter and John went up into the temple, at the hour of Prayer, being the ninth hour,</hi> that is the time of the Evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Hence are ſuch expreſſions as that of the Pſalmiſt <note place="margin">Acts. 3. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet before thee as Incenſe, and the lifting up of my hands, as the Evening Sacrifice.</hi> Nay, it is moſt probable, that when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple were deſtroyed, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple carried captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the daily Sacrifice ceaſed, yet the devout people obſerved the hour of Sacrifice for the prayers. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> prayed three times a day, which moſt likely were Evening and Morning, and Noon. Where Evening and Morning no doubt ſignifie the time of the Evening and Morning <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10. Pſal. 55. 17.</note> Sacrifice; and we are told, that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to <hi>Daniel</hi> while he was praying, and touched him about the time of the Evening oblation. But <hi>2ly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 21.</note> this, when they offered up their Prayers to GOD in other parts of the Nation, or in other Countries. they prayed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple of God, as we now lift up our eyes to Heaven, where God dwells. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Prayer of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, does not only beg of God to hear thoſe Prayers, which were made towards it, as the words muſt ſignifie in ſeveral places. In general he prays, <hi>Hearken thou to the Prayer of thy ſervant, and of the people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>when they ſhall pray</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>towards this place; (The word in the Hebrew)</hi> may ſignifie both in and towards this place, and includes both, as appears from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances, which refer both to Prayers made in the Temple, and to thoſe prayers which were made towards the Temple by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were at a diſtance. Thus in what ever part of the Nation they wanted rain, which might be at a great diſtance from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they were to pray towards this place. <note place="margin">ver. 35.</note> The ſame was to be done in caſe of Famine and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if they were beſiged in any of their Cities, when they could not go to the Temple to pray. Nay, <hi>What Prayer or ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſoever ſhall be made by any man, or by all thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which ſhall know every man the plague of his</hi>

                        <hi>own heart, and ſpread forth his hands towards this houſe, then</hi>
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:98824:90"/> 
                        <hi>hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place and forgive.</hi> Thus when they went out to battle, they were to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and towards the Temple. <note place="margin">verſ. 44.</note> And when they were carried captive into their enemies land, they were to pray to God toward the land which God had given them, towards the Holy City, and towards the Temple. And accordingly it was the conſtant practice <note place="margin">verſ. 48.</note> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to pray three times a day to God, with his windows open in his chamber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that though the Temple were not the only place where they might lawfully pray to God; yet all their Prayers were to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Temple, and receive their vertue and acceptation from their relation to the Temple and the Temple-worſhip. This was a ſtanding rule for the whole Jewiſh Nation, that whenever they prayed, they offered up their prayers in the Temple or towards it; and this is generally obſerved by them to this day: For the reaſon why they generally now turn themſelves toward the Eaſt when they pray, is not out of any reſpect to the riſing of the Sun, but becauſe they live in Weſtern Countries; and ſo by turning to the Eaſt, they look towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the place where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood. And this is as plain an evidence, that all <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Buxtorfii Synag. Jud.</hi> p. 222.</note> their prayers as well as Sacrifices, were to be offered onely to that GOD who dwelt in the Temple. And therefore as they are commanded to pray to God, and this is made the peculiar attribute of God, <hi>that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſalm 65. 2. Joſh. 23. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>prayers, and therefore unto him ſhall all fleſh come;</hi> ſo they are expreſly commanded <hi>not to make mention of the name of the Heathen gods;</hi> that is, not to pray to them; the prayers of the Heathens conſiſting of a frequent repetition of the names of their gods, as we ſee in the prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> who cried from morning till evening, ſaying, <hi>O Baal hear us.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Kin. 18. 26</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Jews were commanded to bring all their Vows, firſt Fruits, Tythes, and offerings, to the Temple, which is a plain ſign to whom they were offered. The Seventh-day-Sabbath was a ſign that they worſhip'd that God who created the world in ſix days, and reſted on the ſeventh, and delivered them from their Egyptian Bondage, and gave them reſt in that good Land, both which reaſons are aſſigned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore God command them by the prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Nallow my ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>They had but three ſolemn Feſtivals every year, and they were all in remembrance of the great Works of God, and all the Males

                     </p>
                     <p>And as they were to pray only to God, ſo they were onely to ſwear by his Name which is another part of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and therefore to ſwear by the Lord of Hoſts is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 21 Iſa. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>So that all the parts of the Jewiſh Worſhip were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Lord Jehovah, he was the only object of their dread and fear, and religious Adorations. And when we conſider that God had choſen them to be a peculiar people to himſelf, that the Land was a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, Gods peculiar Inheritance, which he gave by promiſe to their Fathers; and the Temple was his Houſe where he dwelt among them, it cannot be expected that any other Gods might be worſhip'd by ſuch a people, in ſuch a Land and in ſuch a houſe, as God had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>3. It is very conſiderable, that we have no approved example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, of any worſhip pay'd to Saints or Angels, or any other Beeing, but God alone. We have too many ſad examples of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Jews both in worſhipping the Molten Calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> made, and <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves and <hi>Baalim</hi>'s, and other Heathen gods; but had it been allowed by their Law to have pay'd any inferiour degree of Religious Worſhip to Saints and Angels (which is now aſſerted by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a matter of ſuch great benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to mankind) it is a very ſtrange, that we ſhould not have one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it throughout the Scripture, nor any authentick Records a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewiſh Writers: All the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> are directed to God alone, and yet we cannot think but ſuch a devout man would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſome Hymns upon his Patron and tutelar Saints, had he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd any ſuch, as well as the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſts do now.</p>
                     <p>This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſees and acknowledges, and thinksſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers too, when ſhe gives us the reaſon why it could not be ſo under the Law; becauſe thoſe Old Teſtament-Saints were not then admitted into Heaven, to the immediate viſion and fruition of God; Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were not opened till the reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therefore thoſe bleſſed Spirits were not in a condition to be our Interceſſors and Mediators, till they were received into Heaven; but now Saints and Martyrs aſcend directly into Heaven, and reign with Chriſt in Glorie, and it ſeems ſhare with him in his peculiar Worſhip and Glorie too.</p>
                     <p>Now 1. Whither this be ſo or not, the Scriptures aſſign no ſuch reaſon for it; and therfore it is likely there might be other reaſons, and I think I have made it very plain that there was. We are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for what reaſons the Jewiſh Church did not worſhip Saints and Angels, but whither they did worſhip them or not; and it appears that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98824:91"/> they never did; ſo that we have neither precept nor example for this, during all the time of the Jewiſh Church: which is all we intend to prove by this argument.</p>
                     <p>2. But yet it is evident, that this is not a good reaſon why the Jews did not worſhip Angels under the Law. For certainly Angels were as much in Heaven then, as they are now, whatever Saints were. They are repreſented in the Old Teſtament, as the conſtant Attendants and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tinue of God, and the great Miniſters of his Providence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were as capable of Divine Worſhip in the time of the Law as they are now, nay, I think, a little more. For the Law it ſelf, was given by the Miniſtry of Angels, and their appearances were more frequent and familiar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the world ſeemed to be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of Angels then, then it is now, ſince Chriſt is made the Head of the Church, and exalted above all principalities and powers.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſometimes the Advocates of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> make ſome little offers to prove the worſhip of Angels in thoſe days: to this purpoſe they alledge that form of benediction, which <hi>Jacob</hi> uſed in bleſſing the Sons of <hi>Joſheph, The</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 44. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Angel which redemed me from all evil, bleſs the Lads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 1. This is not a direct prayer to the Angel, but onely his committing of them to the care and patronage of that Angel, with a prayer to God for that purpoſe; And if he by experience had found that God had appointed his Angel to defend and protect him, it was but reaſonable to pray to God, that the ſame Angel might protect his poſterity.</p>
                     <p>2. But yet according to the ſenſe of the Antient Fathers, this was no created Angel and Spirit, but the Son and Word of God, the Angel of the preſence, who is ſo often in Scripture ſtiled <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> a name which can belong to no created Spirit. And it is no hard matter to make it highly probable, that this is that Angel who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>Jacob</hi> out of all his troubles. But it is ſtrange if Angels were worſhipped under the Old Teſtament, we ſhould have no clearer and plainer evidence of it, then ſuch a ſingle Text, which was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded either by any Jewiſh or Chriſtian Writers to this ſenſe, till of late dayes; and here the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are to be put in mind of their Oath to expound Scripture according to the unanimous conſent of the Ancient Fathers.</p>

There is no way of altering any Divine Laws, but by a new revelation of Gods will, and there is no way to give Authority to ſuch a revelation, but by Miracles or Propheſie; but in this caſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Propheſie it ſelf can give no authority, becauſe God himſelf has expreſly forbid us to hearken to any Prophet, whatever ſigns or wonders are wrought by him, who teacheth the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides the one Supreme God. So that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly forbid the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides God, and as expreſly forbid us to hearken to any Prophet, though a worker of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, who teaches any other worſhip, it is impoſſible, this Law ſhould ever be altered, becauſe we are before-hand warned by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to give credit to any Prophet whatever he be, or whatever he do, who attempts any alteration of it. And therefore had Chriſt or his Apoſtle taught the worſhip of Saints and Angels, it had been a juſt reaſon for the unbelief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that were wrought by them; and it is well the <hi>Jews</hi> never had any juſt occaſion to make this objection againſt our Saviour, for if they had, I know not how it would have been anſwered. I ſay a <hi>juſt occaſion,</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> did urge this very Law againſt him before <hi>Pilate. We have a Law and by our Law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> In which they refer to <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 7.</note> that diſcourſe of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10. 29, 30. where he affirms that God is his Father, and plainly tells them, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> for which ſaying they attempt to ſtone him for blaſphemy, and that being a man, he made himſelf a God. <hi>v.</hi> 33. But though he did indeed (as the <hi>Jews</hi> rightly inferred) make himſelf a God by this ſaying, yet he did not preach any new God to them, but affirmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be one with the Father, that ſame Supreme God, the Lord <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> whom they were commanded to worſhip by their Law; he made no alteration in the object of their worſhip, but onely did more clearly and diſtinctly reveal the Father to them, as manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in and by his only begotten Son. And therefore he did not offend againſt this Law, by ſeducing them to the worſhip of any other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Lord <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which if he had done, their accuſation had been juſt, and all the Miracles which he did, could not have ſecured him from the guilt and puniſhment of an Impoſtor.</p>
                     <p>Which ſhews us, what force there is in that Argument which the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98824:93"/> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> urges from theſe Miracles, which have been wrought at the Tombs of Martyrs, to prove the Religious invocation of them; if ſuch Miracles were ever wrought, it was in teſtimony to the truth of Chriſtianity, for which they ſuffered, not to betray men to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and idolatrous worſhip of them; ten thouſand Miracles ſhould never convince me of the lawfulneſs of praying to Saints departed while I have ſuch a plain and expreſs Law againſt believing all Miracles upon any ſuch account.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it reaſonably be ſaid, that this Law was given only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore oblidges none but them; for we muſt remember, that Chriſt was originally ſent to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and therefore by this Law, he was bound not to teach the worſhip of any other Beeings, under the penalty of death; and they were bound not to own and receive him if he did; and therefore it was impoſſible for the true Meſſias to introduce the worſhip of any Beeing, beſides the one ſupreme God; and if Chriſt could not teach any ſuch Doctrine, I know not how the worſhip of Saints and Angels ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to be a Doctrine of Chriſtianity. For what Chriſt himſelf cannot do, none of his Followers may, who had no other Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion but to teach thoſe things which they had learn'd from him; and he could not give commiſſion to preach ſuch Doctrines, as he himſelf had no authority to preach.</p>
                     <p>So that though this Law was not originally given to the Gentiles, but only to the Jews: yet it equally oblidges the Chriſtian Church, whither Jews or Gentiles, becauſe Chriſt himſelf, who was the Author of our Religion was oblidged by it. The worſhip of one Supreme God, and of none elſe, is as fundamental to Chriſtianity, as it is to <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is now, or ought to be, the Religion of the Jews, as well as Gentiles; and yet the Jews are expreſly forbid by this Law ever to own any Religion, which allows the worſhip of any Beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God: and therefore the worſhip of one God and none elſe, muſt be fundamental in Chriſtianity, if the people of the Jews are, or ever were bound to embrace the Faith of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges the Heathens with Idolatry, he does it upon this account, that they joyned the worſhip of Creatures, with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Supreme God. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi> Where the Apoſtle acknowledges, that they did know God, that <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> they did own that Supreme and Soveraign Beeing who made the world: and does ſuppoſe, that they did worſhip him alſo. For he does not charge them with renouncing the worſhip of that God who made the world, but that they did <hi>not glorifie him as God;</hi> which only taxes the manner of their worſhip. And wherein that was faulty he declares in the following verſes. As that they made mean and vile repreſentations of him, that <hi>they</hi>

                        <hi>changed the Glory of the uncorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds and four footed beaſts, &amp; creeping things.</hi> And thus <hi>changed the the truth of God into a lie.</hi> But this was not the only fault, but they alſo gave his incommunicable worſhip to Creatures, <hi>and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature more then the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever, Amen.</hi> Which words do <note place="margin">verſ. 25.</note> plainly ſuppoſe, that they did worſhip the Creator of all things, but beſides the Creator, (for ſo <hi>para</hi> may ſignifie) they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the creature alſo; which proves that the worſhip of the Supreme God will not excuſe thoſe from Idolatry, who worſhip any thing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him. For the oppoſition lies between the Creator, and the creature, be it good or a bad creature, it matters not as to Religious Worſhip, which muſt be given to neither. Or if we render the words, as our Tranſlators do, <hi>more then the Creator,</hi> (for <hi>para</hi> is often uſed compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) yet ſo it ſuppoſes, that they did worſhip the Creator, &amp; when they are ſaid to worſhip the Creature <hi>more,</hi> that cannot ſignifie a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of worſhip, but more frequent addreſſes (and thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> worſhips the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> more then the Creator; for they ſay ten prayers (if they be prayers) to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for one to God ten <hi>Ave Maries</hi> for one <hi>Pater noſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Apoſtle determines this matter in as plain words as can be: For <hi>though there can be, that are called</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 5, 6</note>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98824:94"/> or Mediators and Interceſſors for them with the Supreme GOD, the Apoſtle plainly aſſerts, That to us Chriſtians there is but one GOD the maker of all Things, and one LORD JESUS CHRIST our great Mediator and Advocate with GOD the Father; that is, that we muſt worſhip none elſe. And that none of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are uſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to juſtifie that Worſhip, which they pay to Saints and Angels, can have any place here, is evident from this conſideration: For either theſe diſtinctions were known, or they were not known, when the Apoſtle wrote this, and in both caſes ſilence is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, If they were known, he rejects them, and determines againſt them; for he affirms abſolutely without the <hi>ſalvo</hi> of any diſtinctions, that we have but one GOD, and one Mediator; that is, that we muſt worſhip no more. If they were not known (as it is likely they were not, becauſe the Apoſtles takes no notice of them) it is a plain argument, that theſe diſtinctions are of no uſe, unleſs they will ſay, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was guided by an Infallible Spirit, was ignorant of ſome very uſeful and material notions about the object of Worſhip. If the Apoſtle did not know theſe diſtinctions, it is evident they are of a late date, and therefore can have no authority againſt an Apoſtolical determination: If he did not know them, he could have no regard to them, and therefore made no allowance for ſuch exceptions.</p>
                     <p>Nay, the ſame Apoſtle does not only give us ſuch general rules, as neceſſarily exclude the worſhip of Saints and Angels, but does expreſly condemn it, and warns the Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.

                        </note> the Heathens, and the Apoſtle tells us, the time ſhall come, when ſome Chriſtians (for it is evident he ſpeaks here of the Apoſtaſie of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) ſhall fall into the ſame Idolatry; which is an exact prophecy of what we now ſee done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have the ſame notion of their Saints and Angels, and pay the ſame worſhip to them, which the Heathens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did to their Daemons or inferiour Gods.</p>
                     <p>3. And as a farther confirmation of this, I obſerve, that the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98824:94"/> Goſpel of our Savour forbids Idolatry, without giving us any new notion of Idolatry; and therefore it has made no alteration at all in this Doctrine, of the worſhip of one God, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo expreſly commanded the Jews to obſerve. For the Goſpel was preached to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles; nay, the Jews had the firſt &amp; moſt undoubted right to it, as being the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the promiſe of the Meſſias was made; and therefore as the Law was at firſt given them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo it did ſtill oblidge them in all ſuch caſes, wherein the Goſpel did not in expreſs terms make a change &amp; alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law; and therefore ſince there was no ſuch alteration made, and yet the Law againſt Idolatry renewed and confirmed by the authority of the Goſpel, what could the Jews underſtand elſe by Idolatry, but what was accounted Idolatry by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that is, the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides the Supreme GOD, the Lord Jehovah. And ſince it is evident, that there are not two Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, one for the Jews, and another for the Gentiles, all Chriſtians, whither Jews or Gentiles, muſt be under the obligation of the ſame Law, to worſhip only one God.</p>
                     <p>The notion of Idolatry muſt alter as the object of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip does. If we muſt worſhip one God, and none beſides him, then it is Idolatry to worſhip any other Beeing but the Supreme <hi>God,</hi> for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try conſiſts in giving Religious worſhip to ſuch Beeings, as we ought not to worſhip; and by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> they were to worſhip none but God; and therefore the worſhip of any other Beeing was Idolatry. But if the object of our worſhip be enlarged, and the Goſpel has made it lawful to Worſhip Saints and Angels, then we muſt ſeek out ſome other notion of Idolatry, that it conſiſts in worſhipping wicked Spirits, or in giving Supreme and Soveraign worſhip to inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks impoſſible in the nature of the thing, for any man to do, who knows them to be inferiour Spirits. But if Idolatry be the ſame under the New Teſtament, that it was under the Old, the object of our worſhip muſt be the ſame too; and we have reaſon to believe, that it is the ſame, when we are commanded to keep our ſelves from Idols, and to flie from Idolatry, but are no where in the New Teſtament expreſly told, what this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is; which ſuppoſes, that we muſt learn what it is, from ſome antecedent Laws, and there were no ſuch Laws in being but the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The only thing that can be ſaid in this caſe, is, that the Apoſtle refers them not to any written Law, but to the natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Idolatry: but with what reaſon this is ſaid, will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider to whom the Apoſtle writes; and they were but Jewiſh and Heathen Converts. As for the Heathens, they had corrupted all their natural notions of Idolatry, and had no ſenſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98824:95"/> at all of this ſin till they were converted to Chriſtianity; and therefore they were not likely to underſtand the true notion of Idolatry without being taught it; and it is not probable the Apoſtles would leave them to gueſs what Idolatry is. As for the Jews, God would not from the beginning truſt to their natural notions, but gave them expreſs Laws about Idolatry, which though they are the ſame Laws which natural reaſon dictates to us, as moſt agreeable to the nature and worſhip of God, yet ſince the experience of the world, which was over-run by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worſhip, ſufficiently prove, that all men do not uſe their reaſon aright in theſe matters, God would not truſt to the uſe of their reaſon in the weighty concernments of his own worſhip and glory, but gives them an expreſs poſitive Law about it; and Chriſt and his Apoſtles having done nothing to repeal this Law, they leave them under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it; and when they warn them againſt Idols and Idolatry, without giving them any new Laws about it, muſt in all reaſon be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to refer them to thoſe Laws, which they already had.</p>

                     <p>4. AS a farther proof of this, I obſerve, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not abrogate, but only complete and perfect the Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aical Laws. Our Saviour with great zeal and earneſtneſs diſowns any ſuch intention or deſign. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfil. pleroſai</hi> to fill it up, by fulfilling the types and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note place="margin">5.

And therefore he adds, <hi>For verily I ſay unto you, Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was lookt on by the believing Jews as a great enemy to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſuch pretences. <hi>Do we then make void the</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed had Chriſt or his Apoſtles attempted to have given any new Laws contrary to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it had juſtified the Jews in their unbelief, for God by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> had given this expreſs rule to examine all new Doctrines by; <hi>To the law and the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them;</hi> and that <note place="margin">Iſai. 8. 20.</note> Chriſt himſelf is not excepted from this rule, appears in this, that this is joyned with the prophecie of the Meſſias, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after; as you may ſee in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8 13. 14. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 6. 7. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles alwayes make their appeals to the writings of the Old Teſtament, and <hi>St. Paul</hi> in all his diſputes with the Jews urges them with no other authority but the Scriptures; and thö the Miracles which were wrought by the Apoſtles did move the Jews to hearken to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98824:95"/> them, and greatly diſpoſe them to believe their Doctrine, yet it was the authority of the Scriptures whereon their Faith was founded. As S. <hi>Peter</hi> tels thoſe to whom he wrote, that though they preach'd nothing to them concerning the coming of Chriſt, but what they were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of; and though God had given teſtimony to him by a voice from Heaven, which they heard, when they were with him in the holy Mount, yet he adds, <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as to a light,</hi>

                        <hi>that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> That is the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; and therefore the Jews of <hi>Berea</hi> are greatly commended for their diligence in ſearching the Scriptures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine by them; and this is aſſigned <note place="margin">Acts 17. 10. 11.</note> as the reaſons why many of them believed.</p>
                     <p>To apply this then to our preſent purpoſe, I obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That if Chriſt did not make any new Laws in contradiction to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then he could make no alteration in the object of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip. He could not introduce the worſhip of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels without contradicting that Law, which commands us to worſhip no other Beeing but the one Supreme God. For the worſhip of Saints and Angels together with the Supreme God, is a direct contradiction to that Law, which commands us to worſhip God alone; though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that in the nature of the thing, the worſhip of Saints and Angels were conſiſtent with the worſhip of the Supreme God, yet it is not conſiſtent with that Law, which commands us to worſhip none but God. So that let this be a natural or poſitive Law, or whatever men pleaſe to call it, it is a very plain and expreſs Law, and Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did contradict any expreſs Law of God.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that Typical and Ceremonial Worſhip, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Jews to obſerve, is now out of date under the Goſpel, and does no longer oblidge Chriſtians; but the reaſon of that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has received its accompliſhment and perfection in Chriſt. Chriſt has perfected the Jewiſh Sacrifices, and put an end to them, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more perfect and meritorious ſacrifice, even the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Circumciſion, waſhings, Purifications of the Law, are perfected by the Laws of internal purity. The external Ceremonies of the Law ceaſe, but they are perfected by an Evangelical righteouſneſs. But this I ſay, that Chriſt never repealed any Moſaical Law, but by fulfilling and perfecting it. He came not to deſtroy the Law, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil.

                        </gap>s and Angels is not a fulfilling, but a deſtroying that Law, which commands us to worſhip none but God. And it is not enough to ſay, that theſe are poſitive Laws given to the Jews, (though that be ſaid without
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98824:96"/> any reaſon) for let them ſhew me any poſitive Law relating to the worſhip of GOD, which Chriſt has wholly abrogated without ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet as a farther proof, that Chriſt has made no alteration in the object of our worſhip, that he has not introduced the worſhip of Saints or Angels, or Images, into the Chriſtian Church, which was ſo expreſly forbid by the Jewiſh Law, I obſerve that according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours own rule, that <hi>he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil;</hi> theſe Laws of worſhipping one God, and none beſides him, were not lyable to any change and alteration, becauſe there was nothing to be perfected or fulfilled in them. He made no change or alteration but by way of perfecting and fulfilling; and therefore thoſe Laws which had nothing to be fulfilled, muſt remain as they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change.</p>
                     <p>To perfect or fulfil a law, muſt either ſignifie to accompliſh what was prefigured by it, and thus Chriſt fulfilled all the types and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Law, which related to his Perſon, or his undertaking, as the Jewiſh Prieſthood, and Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to preſcribe that real righteouſneſs which was ſignified and repreſented by the outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſo Chriſt fulfilled the Laws of circumciſion, Waſhing, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications, Sabbaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by commanding the Circumciſion of the heart, and the purity of mind and ſpirit: or by ſupplying what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; and thus he fulfilled the moral Law by new inſtances of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by requiring ſomething more perfect of us, then what the letter of the Moſaical Law enjoyned. Theſe are all the wayes that <hi>I</hi> know of and all that we have any inſtances of in Scripture of fulfilling Laws.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſuppoſe, no man will ſay, that the firſt Commandment, which forbids <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he worſhip of any other Gods beſides the Lord Jehovah, is a Typical Law, for pray what is it a Type of? nor can any pretend that the firſt Commandment is a ceremonial Law, for it preſcribes no rite of worſhip at all, but onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> determines the object of worſhip.</p>
                     <p>As for the third way of fulfilling Laws, by perfecting them with ſome new inſtances and degrees of vertue, it can have no place here, for this Law is as perfect as it can be. For it is a Negative Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other GOD.</hi> Now that which is forbid without any reſerve o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> limitation, is perfectly and abſolutely forbid. There are no degrees of nothing, though there are ſeveral degrees of perfection in things which have beeing; and therefore though there are degrees in affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws, for ſome Laws may require greater attainments then other; and one man may do better then another, and yet both do that which is good; yet there are no degrees in not doing a thing, and no Law can do more then forbid that, which the Law-giver will not have done.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his way of fulfilling Laws, does not abrogate any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but adds to it; it may reſtrain thoſe liberties which were
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98824:96"/> formerly indulged, but it does not forbid any thing which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our duty to do; for when GOD requires greater degrees of vertue from us, he does not forbid the leſs. And therefore in this way Chriſt might forbid more then was forbid by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but we cannot ſuppoſe that he gave liberty to do that which the law forbids, which is not to perfect, but to abrogate a Law.</p>
                     <p>But to put an end to this diſpute; if Chriſt have perfected theſe Laws by indulging the worſhip of Saints and Angels under the Goſpel, which was ſo expreſlly forbidden by the Law, then it ſeems the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints and Angels is a more perfect ſtate of Religion, then the worſhip of the one ſupreme God alone.</p>
                     <p>If this be true, then though the Heathens might miſtake in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their worſhip was yet the manner of their worſhip was more perfect and excellent, then what God himſelf preſcribed the Jews. For they worſhiped a great many inferiour Deities, as well as the ſupreme God; and if this be the moſt perfect and excellent worſhip it is wonderful to me, that God ſhould forbid it in the worſhip of himſelf; that he ſhould preſcribe a more imperfect worſhip to his own people, then the Heathens paid to their Gods.</p>
                     <p>For to ſay that God forbade the worſhip of any Beeing beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe this liberty had been abuſed by the Heathens to Idolatry, is no reaſon at all. For though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Heathens worſhiped evil ſpirits for Gods, this had been eaſily prevented, had God told them what Saints and Angels they ſhould have made their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to; and this had been a more likely way to cure them of Idolatry then to have forbid the worſhip of all inferiours Deities; for when they had ſuch numerous Dieties of their own to have made their applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, they would have been more eaſily weaned from the Gods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
                     <p>And we have reaſon to believe, ſo it would have been, had GOD been pleaſed with this way of worſhip, for he would not reject any part of religious worſhip, meerly, becauſe it had been abuſed by Idolaters. The Heathens ſacrificed to Idols, and yet he commands the Jews to offer Sacrifices to himſelf, and ſo no doubt he would have commanded the worſhip of Saints and Angels, had he been as well pleaſed with this, as he was with Sacrifices; had it been a more perfect ſtate of Religion then to worſhip God only, and without any Image.</p>
                     <p>When God choſe the people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeparated them from the reſt of the world, to his own peculiar worſhip and ſervice, we cannot ſuppoſe that he did intend to forbid any acts of worſhip, which were a real honour to the Divine Nature, much leſs to forbid the moſt excellent and perfect acts of worſhip; for he who is ſo jealous
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98824:97"/> of his glory, will no more part with it himſelf, then he will give it to another; and therefore excepting the Typical nature of that diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole intention of the Moſaical Law was to correct thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, which the reſt of the world was guilty of in their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which either reſpected the object or the acts of worſhip; that they worſhip'd that for God, which was not God; or that they thought to honour God by ſuch acts, as were ſo far from being an honour, that they were a reproach to the Divine Nature. And whatever is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in the worſhip of God, unleſs there be ſome Myſtical and Typical reaſons for it, muſt be reduced to one of thoſe cauſes. This account God himſelf gives, why he forbids the worſhip of any Beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, or the worſhip of graven Images <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my glory will I not give to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>another, nor my praiſe to graven Images.</hi> Whatever is his true glory, he reſerves to himſelf, and therefore never did forbid any act of worſhip which was truly ſo; but he will not give his glory to another, and for that reaſon forbids the worſhip of graven Images, or any thing beſides himſelf; and if this was not his glory then much leſs the moſt perfect and excellent part of worſhip, I know not how it ſhould come to be his glory now, unleſs the Divine Nature changes and alters too.</p>
                     <p>So that God having forbid by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides himſelf, is a very ſtrong preſumption, that the worſhip of Saints and Angels, (whatever fine excuſes and Apologies may be made for it, yet at leaſt) is not a more perfect ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then to worſhip God alone. For though God may not alwayes think fit to command the higheſt degrees of perfection, yet there never can be any reaſon to forbid it. But let us now conſider the nature &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thing, whither it be a more perfect ſtate of Religion to worſhip God alone, or to worſhip Saints and Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with the Supreme God. Now the perfection of any acts of Religion muſt either reſpect God or our ſelves, that they ſignifie ſome greater perfections in God, or more perfect attainments in us, and a nearer union and conjunction with the Deity. Let us then briefly examine the worſhip of Saints and Angels. both with reſpect to God and ourſelves, and ſee whither we can diſcover any greater perfection in this way of worſhip, then the worſhip of the Supreme B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eing alone, without any Rival or partner in worſhip; and if it appears, that it is neither for the glory of God, nor for the happineſs and perfection of thoſe who worſhip, we may certainly conclude, that our Saviour has made no alteration in the object of our worſhip, for he made no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the worſe but for the better, he fulfills and perfects Laws, which, I ſuppoſe, does not ſignifie, making them leſs perfect then they were before.</p>

                     <p>1. THen let us conſider, whither the worſhip of Saints and Angels be more for the glory of God, then to pay all Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God alone. Now if Religious Worſhip be for the glory of God then all religious worſhip is more for Gods glory then a part of it; unleſs men will venture to ſay, that a part is as great as the whole. And yet whoever worſhips Saints and Angels, though he be never ſo devout a worſhiper of God alſo, yet he gives part of Religious Worſhip to Creatures, and therefore God cannot have the whole, unleſs they can divide their worſhip between God and Creatures, and yet give the whole to God.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected, that thoſe who worſhip Saints and Angels, do not give that worſhip to them, which is peculiar and appropriate to the Supreme God, and therefore they reſerve that worſhip which is due to GOD, wholly to himſelf, though they pay an inferiour degree of Religions Worſhip to Saints and Angels. I anſwer what that worſhip is, which is peculiar to the Supreme God, <hi>I</hi> ſhall conſider more hereafter; but for the preſent, ſuppoſing that they gave only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree of worſhip to creatures, is this Religious Worſhip, or is it not? If it be, is a degree of Worſhip a part of Worſhip? if it be, then God has not the whole, and therefore is not ſo much honoured, as if he had the whole; as to ſhew this in a plain inſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who pray to Saints and Angels, though they do not pray to them, as to the Supreme God, but as to Mediators and Interceſſors for them with the Supreme God, yet they place an inferiour degree of hope and truſt and affiance in them, or elſe it is non-ſence to pray to them at all; ſo that though God may be the Spreme Object of their relyance and hope, yet he is not the only Object; he has part, and the greateſt part, but not the whole, for they divide their hope and truſt between God and Creatures; and it be a greater glory to God to truſt wholly in him, then to truſt in him in part, then it is a greater glory to God to pray to him only, then to pray alſo to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                     <p>Nay it is more then probable, that thoſe who pray to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as truſting in their merits and interceſſion for them, do not make God, but theſe Saints and Angels, to whom they pray, the Supreme Object of their hope. This it may be well be thought an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant charge againſt men who profeſs to believe, that God is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of the world, and the ſole giver of all good things; but this is no argument to me, but that notwithſtanding this belief, they may truſt more in Saints and Angels, then in God, and conſequently give the Supreme Worſhip to them. For men do not alwayes truſt moſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98824:98"/> in thoſe who have the greateſt power, but in thoſe by whoſe intereſt and interceſſion, they hope to obtain their deſires of the Soveraign power. Thus I am ſure it is in the Courts of earthly Princes; though men know, that the King only has power to grant what they deſire, yet they place more confidence in a powerfull Favorite then in their prince, and when they have obtained their requeſts, pay more acknowledgments to their Patron; for let the power be where it will, our hope and truſt is plac'd there where our expectations are. And when mens expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not from the Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who has the power, but from the Favorite, whoſe intereſt directs the influences of this power to them, which otherwiſe would never reach them, ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites have more numerous dependents, more frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, more formal courtſhips, then the Prince himſelf. And when men model the heavenly Court according to the pattern of earthly Courts; and expect the conveyance of the Divine Bleſſings to them as much from the interceſſion of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as they do to to obtain their deſires of their Prince, by the mediation of ſome powerful Favourite, no wonder, if they love, and honour, and fear, reverence and adore, truſt and depend on Saints and Angels, as much or more then they do on the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme GOD. For there is not a more natural notion, then to honour thoſe for our GODS, from whoſe hands we receive all good things, whither we receive it from their own inherent power or not.

                     <p>Men may acknowledge GOD to be the Supreme Beeing, and aſcribe incommunicable perfections to him, and yet may pray more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more devoutly, more ardently, with greater truſt and affiance to Saints and Angels, then to GOD, as it is apparent many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votoes of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> do; and this is to give Supreme and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Worſhip to them, without acknowledging them to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Beeings.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it is morally impoſſible, but our Religious Worſhip, and affiance, muſt be at leaſt equally ſhared between the Supreme God and our Mediator, whatever he be, as men do not leſs truſt in the intereſt of their Patron, then in the power of their Prince; for it is not meer power but favour, which is the immediate object of our truſt; and therefore God appointed his only begotten Son to be our Mediator, as for other great and wiſe reaſons, ſo to prevent I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry by giving us a God incarnate, who is a proper object of Religious adoration, to be our Mediator, that ſeing men will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98824:98"/> their Mediator, they may have a God for their Mediator to worſhip. The ſum is this: If it be more for the glory of God to have all Religious Worſhip appropriated to himſelf, then to have only a part of it, and it may be the leaſt ſhare and part too, then the worſhip of Saints and Angels cannot be for Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this, the worſhip of Saints and Angels, together with God, does mightily obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure and leſſen the Divine perfections, and therefore it cannot be for his glory. It repreſents him indeed like a great Temporal Monarch, but it does not repreſent him like a God.</p>
                     <p>That which we ignorantly think a piece of ſtate and greatneſs in earthly Monarchs, to adminiſter the great affairs of their Kingdoms, to receive Petitions and Addreſſes, to beſtow Favours, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter juſtice by other hands, to have ſome great Miniſters and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites to interpoſe between them and their Subject, is nothing elſe, but want of power to do otherwiſe. He would be a much greater Prince, more beloved and reverenced, who could do all this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but no Prince can be preſent in all parts of his Kingdom, nor know every particular ſubject, much leſs their particular caſes, and conditions, deſerts and merits; and therefore is forc'd to divide this care into many hands, and in ſo doing ſhares his power and honour with his Subjects. But whoever imagines any ſuch thing of God, denies his omnipreſence, his omnipotence, his omniſcience, and his particular care and providence over his Creatures. God indeed does not alwayes govern the world by an immediate power, but makes uſe both of the Miniſtry of Angels and Men; but he governs all things by his immediate direction, or at leaſt by his immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. He overlooks every thing himſelf, while all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures either obey his commands, or ſubmit to his power. If this be the true notion of Gods governing the world, that he has the concernments of the whole Creation under his eye, and keeps the diſpoſal of all things in his own hands, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done, but either by his order or permiſſion; then the moſt perfect and glorious Angels, the greateſt Miniſters of the Divine Providence, can challenge no ſhare in Religious Worſhip, cannot be the objects of our truſt or hope, becauſe they are only Miniſters of the Divine Will, can do nothing from themſelves, as civil Miniſters of State, and Officers of great truſt can in Temporal Kingdoms, but are alwayes under the eye, and alwayes move at the command of God. In ſuch a ſtate of things all the peculiar rights of Soveraign Power and Dominion God reſerves wholly to himſelf, as any wiſe Prince would, among which the receiving the Prayers and Petitions
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98824:99"/> of his Creatures is none of the leaſt; to hear Prayers is made the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar attribute of God in Scripture, <hi>Thou art a God that heareſt prayers, therefore unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> And reaſon tells us, that it is the moſt eminent part of Soveraignity and Majeſty; and the reaſon why Temporal Princes do not reſerve this wholly to themſelves, is becauſe they cannot do it; but God can, and he challenges it to himſelf, and will not allow any Creature to do it; and there is no temptation to pray to any creature, when we know, that they cannot help us, that they muſt receive their orders and commands from God, and do not act by their own will and inclinations.</p>
                     <p>Thus Princes have their Favourites, to whom they expreſs a very partial fondneſs and reſpect, to whom they will deny nothing that they ask, nor hardly ſhew any grace or favour to their Subjects without them; and this forces Subjects to addreſs themſelves to their Prince by them; but it is a reproach to the Divine goodneſs and univerſal Providence, to conceive any ſuch thing of God; which yet is the foundation of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Patron Saints and Angels, as perſons ſo dear to God, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny their requeſts, &amp; will not grant our Petitions without them, or at leaſt, that is the moſt certain and effectual way to obtain what we deſire, to offer up our Prayers and Petitions to God by their hands.</p>
                     <p>No doubt but all good men on earth, much more Bleſſed Saints and Angels in Heaven, as being more perfect and excellent Creatures, are very dear to God; but yet God is not fond and partial in his kindneſs, as earthly Princes are, but has an equal regard to all his Creatures, and delights in doing good to them, and needs not to be importuned by any powerful Favourites to hear their cryes and prayers; he will as ſoon attend to the Prayers of an humble penitent ſinner, as of the moſt glorious ſaint, and is more ready to grant then they are to ask.</p>
                     <p>A Mediator of Redemption is very conſiſtent with the perfections of the Divine Nature, and does mightily recommend both the goodneſs and wiſdom of God to the world. When Mankind had tranſgreſſed the Laws of their creation, they forfeited their natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the care and goodneſs of their Maker; The Divine Juſtice, and the wiſdom of God in the government of the world, required an atonement and expiation for ſin; and it was an amazing demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Divine goodneſs to ſinners, that he found one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he gave his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins. When men by ſin had forfeit their original innocence and happineſs together, they could expect nothing from God, but by way of convenant and promiſe; and every covenant between contending parties, muſt be tranſacted in the hands of a Mediator, and none ſo fit to be our Mediator, as he who is our ranſome too.</p>
                     <p>And a Mediator muſt be inveſted with power and authority to ſee the terms of this covenant performed, and this is his Mediatory
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98824:99"/> Interceſſion. He interceeds not meerly as a powerful Favourite, but as the Author and Surety of the covenant, not meerly by intreaties and prayers, but in vertue of his blood, which ſealed the covenant, and made atonement and expiation for ſin.</p>
                     <p>Thus Chriſt is our Mediator of redemption, who hath redeemed us by his blood; and we muſt offer up all our prayers to God in his name and powerful interceſſion, becauſe we can expect no bleſſings from God, but by vertue of that covenant, which he purchaſt and ſealed with his blood.</p>
                     <p>But now a Mediator of pure interceſſion, without regard to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made for ſin, or any covenant of redemption (ſuch as Saints and Angels and the bleſſed Virgin are made by the church of <hi>Rome)</hi> is a mighty reproach to the Divine Nature and perfections. It cloaths God with the paſſions and infirmities of earthly Princes; repreſents him as extreamly fond of ſome of his Creatures, and very regardleſs of others; as if his kindneſs to ſome favourite Saint, were a more powerful motive to him to do good, then his own love to goodneſs; as if he knew not when, nor to whom, to ſhew mercy with out their direction or counſel, or would not do it without their importunity; as if ſome of his Creatures had as much the aſcendant over him, as ſome favourites have over their Princes, who can with a words ſpeaking have any thing of them and extort favours from them, even againſt their wills and inclinations. No man can think there is any need of ſuch Interceſſours and Mediators with God, who believes him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe, and to be infinitely good; to know when it is fit to hear and to anſwer, and to be alwayes ready to do, what his own wiſdom judges fit to be done. There can be no place for ſuch interceſſions and intreaties, to an infinitely perfect Beeing (For they alwayes ſuppoſe ſome great weakneſs or defect in him who want them, for even a wiſe and a good man wants no Mediators to perſwade him to do that good, which is fit to be done. The Objection againſt this is very obvious, and the Anſwer, I think, is as eaſie. The Objection is this: If God be ſo good, that he needs not ſuch Prayers and Interceſſions, to move him to do good, Why do we pray for our ſelves? Why do we pray for one another? Why do we deſire the Prayers of good men here on earth? Why is it a greater reproach to the Divine Perfections to beg the Prayers of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> now they are in Heaven, then to have begged their Prayers, while they had been on Earth?</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer: When we pray for our ſelves, I ſuppoſe, we do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is certainly no reproach to the Divine goodneſs, that God makes Prayer the condition of our receiving, which is a very eaſie condition, and very neceſſary to maintain a conſtant ſenſe and reverence of God, and a conſtant dependance on him.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98824:100"/> And when we pray for one another on earth, we are as meer ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, as when we pray for our ſelves, and to pray as ſupplicants is a very different thing from praying as Advocates, as Mediators, as Patrons. The vertue of the firſt conſiſts only in the power and efficacy of Prayer; the ſecond in the favour and intereſt of the perſon. This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf owns, when ſhe allows no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators and Advocats, but Saints in Heaven, which is a ſign, ſhe makes a vaſt difference between the prayers of Saints on earth, and Saints in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>There are great and wiſe reaſons, why God ſhould command and encourage our mutual prayers for each other while we are on earth; for this is the nobleſt exerciſe of univerſal love and charity. which is a neceſſary qualification to render our prayers acceptable to God, this preſerves the unity of the body of Chriſt, which requires a ſympathy and fellow-feeling of each others ſufferings, this is the foundation of publick worſhip when we meet together to pray with, and for each other to our common Father; and it gives a great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vertue and Religion in this world, when God hears the prayers of good men for the wicked, and removes or diverts thoſe judgments which they were afraid of, this becomes the wiſdom of God, and is no blemiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>God does not command us to pray for our ſelves or others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wants our importunities and ſolicitations to do good; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſerves the publick ends of Religion and Government, and is that natural homage and worſhip, which Creatures owe to their great Creator and Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But to imagine, that God needs Advocats and Mediators to ſolicite our cauſe for us in the Court of Heaven, where none of theſe ends can be ſerved by it, this is a plain impeachment of his wiſdom and goodneſs, as if he wanted great importunities to do good, and were more moved by a partial kindneſs and reſpect to ſome powerful Favourites, then by the care of his Creatures, or his love to goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>From hence it evidently appears, how inconſequent that reaſoning is, from our begging the prayers of good men on earth; to prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our praying to the Saints in Heaven to pray and interceed for us; the firſt makes them our fellow ſupplicants, the ſecond makes them our Mediators and Interceſſors; and how little the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gains by that diſtinction, between a Mediator of Redemption, and Mediators of pure Interceſſion; for though they pray to Saints and Angels only as Mediators of Interceſſion, yet this is a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the nature and government of God; a Mediator of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is very conſiſtent with the Divine glory and perfections,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98824:100"/> a Mediator of pure interceſſion is not. And the ſum of all is this, That it is ſo far from advancing the Divine glory to worſhip Saints and Angels together with God, that it is a real reproach and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to him; and therefore this can be no Law nor Inſtitution of our Saviour, who came not to abrogate the Divine Laws, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil and perfect them. Some think there is no danger of diſhonouring God by that honour they give to Saints and Angels, becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them as Gods Friends and Favourites, as thoſe whom God has honoured and advanced to great glory; and therefore whatever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they do to them, rebounds back again on God, and this may be true, while we give no honour to Saints and Angels, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Divine glory; but when the very nature of that honour and worſhip we pay to them, is a diminution of Gods glory, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his infinite perfections, as I have made it appear, the worſhip of Saints and Angels is, ſurely it cannot be for Gods glory to advance his Creatures by leſſening himſelf.</p>

                     <p>2. LEt us now conſider, whither the worſhip of Saints and Angels together with God, be a more perfect ſtate of Religion then the worſhip of God alone, with reſpect to our ſelves; whither it puts us into a more perfect and excellent ſtate. It does indeed migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily gratifie the ſuperſtition of mankind to have a multitude of Advocats and Mediators to addreſs to, but there are three conſiderations which may ſatisfie any man, how far this is from a perfect ſtate of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it argues very mean and low conceits of God, for did men believe God to be ſo wiſe, ſo good, and ſo powerful, as really he is, they would be contented with one infinite God, inſtead of ten thouſand meaner Advocats. The worſhip of Saints and Angels, as <hi>I</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, is a great reproach to the Divine perfections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch worſhippers muſt have very imperfect and childiſh apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Supreme Beeing, which is a plain proof what an imperfect ſtate of Religion this is; for the perfection of Religion is alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to that knowledge we have of God, who is the object of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This worſhip of Saints and Angels is a very ſervile ſtate, it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects us to our fellow-creatures, who are by nature but our equals, however are not our Gods. It is a ſtate of liberty, freedom and honour, to be ſubject to God; who is our natural Lord and Soveraign, But to fall down to our fellow creatures, and to worſhip them with Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, with all humility of addreſs, and ſacred and awful regards, is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98824:101"/> to debaſe our ſelves as much below the dignity of our natures, as we advance them above it. The excellency and perfection of reaſonable Creatures principally conſiſts in their Religion, and that is the moſt perfect Religion, which does moſt advance, adorn, and perfect our Natures; but it is an argument of an abject mind, to be contented to worſhip the moſt excellent creatures, which is a greater diſhonour then to own the vileſt Slave for our Prince. Mean objects of worſhip do more debaſe the Soul, then any other the vileſt ſubmiſſions; and the more our dependencies are, and the meaner they are, the more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. The greateſt perfection of Religion, conſiſts in the neareſt and moſt immediate approach to God; which I think, theſe men cannot pretend to, who fly to the patronage and interceſſion of Saints and Angels, to obtain their Petitions of him. Though we ſhould allow it lawful to pray to Saints and Angels to meditate for us with God, yet we cannot but own it a more perfect ſtate to do as the Saints and Angels themſelves do, go to God without any other Advocat but Chriſt himſelf. It is a great happineſs to have a friend at Court, to commend us to our Prince, when we have no intereſt of our own, but it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er priviledge to go immediately to our Prince when we pleaſe, without any Favourite to introduce us. This is the perfect ſtate of the Goſpel, that we have received <hi>The adoption of Sons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

                        <hi>we are Sons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into our hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> This is, this Holy Spirit which dwells in us, teaches us to call God Father, and to pray to him with the humble aſſurance and confidence of Children. This is the effect of Chriſts interceſſion for us. <hi>That we may now come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98824:101"/> Chriſt our great High Prieſt and Mediator; and if our Prayers be acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt, we need no other Mediators or Advocats. This is the only direction our Saviour gave his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples a little before his death, to ask in his name, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have you asked nothing in my name, ask and ye ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 13, 15. Joh. 16. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> and to give them the greater aſſurance of acceptance, he acquaints them with Gods great and tender affection for them, ſuch as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has for his Children. <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name; and I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">ver. 26, 27.</note> 
                        <hi>for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed, that I came out from God;</hi> a reaſon which equally extends to all thoſe who ſhall believe in Chriſt, to the end of the world. And can we now imagine, that when our Saviour has purchaſt for us this liberty of acceſs to God, he ſhould ſend us round about by the ſhrines and Altars of numerous &amp; unknown Saints to the Throne of Grace. When he will not aſſert the neceſſity of his own prayers for us, while we pray in his name, becauſe our heavenly Father hath ſuch a tender affection for all the Diſciples of Chriſt, can we think it neceſſary to pray to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to pray for us. This is none of our Saviours inſtitution, nor can it be, becauſe Chriſt by his death and ſufferings and interceſſions brings us nearer to God, as the <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19 20, 21, 22.</note> Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Having therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for us through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh, and having an high Prieſt over the houſe of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith.</hi> But the worſhip of Saints and Angels removes us at a great diſtance from God, as not daring to approach his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without the mediation of ſome Favourite Saint. And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does ſometimes pray directly to God only, in the Name and Mediation of Chriſt, as the Pagans themſelves ſometime did to their Supreme Deity: yet it ſeems this is what they dare not truſt to, and therefore joyn the Meditation of Saints with their prayers to God, and never pray to God without it.</p>

                     <p>5. THat the Goſpel of our Saviour has made no alteration in the object of our worſhip, appears from that Analogy which there is and ought to be, between the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Worſhip. The Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church are but one Church, and their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſame worſhip, only with this difference, that the Jewiſh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was in Type and Figure, and Ceremony, the Chriſtian worſhip in Truth and Subſtance. And therefore if this Evangelical worſhip be the ſame it muſt have the ſame object, for the object is the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of worſhip.</p>
                     <p>So that if it appear, not only from the expreſs letter of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from all the Types and Figures of the Law, that God only was to be worſhiped by the Jewiſh Church; if Chriſt was to fulfil all theſe Types and Figures in his own perſon, and in the Evangelical worſhip, then it is certain, that the object of our worſhip muſt be the ſame ſtill; for if the Type was confined in its nature and ſignification to the worſhip of one God, then the whole Chriſtian worſhip, which was ſignified and prefigured by theſe Types, muſt be peculiar and appropriate to the one Supreme GOD.</p>
                     <p>As for inſtance. I have already proved at large, that the Jews were to worſhip but one God, becauſe they had but one Temple to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in, and all their worſhip had ſome relation or other to this one Temple, and therefore all their worſhip was appropriated to that one God, whoſe Temple it was; now we know Gods dwelling in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was only a Type and Figure of Gods dwelling in Humane Nature, upon which account Chriſt calls his body the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>That the word was made fleſh and dwelt among us, es kenosen en hemin</hi> tabernacled <note place="margin">2 Joh. 19. 21. 1 Joh. 14. 2 Coloſſ, 3.</note> among us; as God formerly dwelt in the Jewiſh Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds, <hi>That the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwelt in Chriſt bodily, ſomatikos</hi> realy ſubſtantially, as an accompliſhment of Gods dwelling by Types and Figures, and ſhadows in the Jewiſh Temple.</p>
                     <p>Now if all the Jewiſh worſhip was confined to the Temple, or had a neceſſary relation to it, as I have already proved. and this Temple was but a figure of the Incarnation of Chriſt, who ſhould dwell among us in humane nature, then all the Chriſtian worſhip muſt be offered up to God through Jeſus Chriſt, as all the Jewiſh worſhip was offered to God at the Temple: for Chriſt is the only Temple (in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe) of the Chriſtian Church, and therefore he alone can render all our ſervices acceptable to God. So that God, who is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the only object of our worſhip, and Chriſt conſidered as God Incarnate, as God dwelling in humane nature
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98824:102"/> is the only Temple where all our worſhip muſt be offered to GOD, that is, we ſhall find acceptance with God only in his name and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we muſt worſhip no other Beeing but only the Supreme God, and that only through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus under the Law the Prieſts were to interceed for the people, but not without Sacrifice; their Interceſſion was founded in making ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement and expiation for ſin; which plainly ſignified, that under the Goſpel we can have no other Mediator, but only him, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piates our ſins, and interceeds in the merits of his Sacrifice; who is our Prieſt and our Sacrifice, and therefore our Mediator; as St. <hi>John</hi> obſerves. <hi>If any man ſin, we have</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> The Law knew no ſuch thing as a Mediator of pure interceſſion, a Mediator, who is no Prieſt, and offers no Sacrifice for us, and therefore the Goſpel allows of no ſuch Mediators neither, who mediate only by their prayers, without a Sacrifice, ſuch Mediators as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of Saints and Angels and the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but we have onely one Mediator; a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of redemption, who has purchaſed us with his Blood, of whom the Prieſts under the Law were Types and Figures.</p>
                     <p>Thus under the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none but the High Prieſt was to enter into the Holy of Holies; with the blood of the Sacrifice; now the Holy of Holies was a Type of Heaven, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 12.</note> and therefore this plainly ſignified, that under the Goſpel, there ſhould be but one High Prieſt and Mediator, to offer up our Prayers and Supplications in Heaven, He and He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who enters into Heaven with his own Blood, as the High Prieſt went into the Holy of Holies with the blood of the Sacrifice. There may be a great many Prieſts and Advocates on Earth to interceed for us, as there were under the Law, great numbers of Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to attend the Service and Miniſtry of the Temple, but we have, and can have, but one Prieſt and Mediator in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Whoever acknowledges that the Prieſthood and Miniſtry of the Law was Typical of the Evangelical Prieſthood and Worſhip, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the force of this argument, and whoever will not acknowledge this, muſt reject moſt of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, eſpecially the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, which proceeds wholly upon this way of reaſoning: Now this manifeſtly juſtifies the worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as true Chriſtian worſhip, for we worſhip One God through one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice for us, when he was on Earth, and interceeds for us as our High Prieſt in Heaven, which anſwers to the One Temple, and the One High Prieſt under the Law: But though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does what we do, worſhip the Supreme GOD through Jeſus Chriſt, yet ſhe ſpoils the Analogie between the Type and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98824:103"/> the Antitype, the legal and Evangelical worſhip, by doing more; when ſhe ſends us to the Shrines and Altars of ſo many ſeveral Saints, ſurely this cannot anſwer to that one Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where God alone was to be worſhipped, there are many Temples and Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeats now, as there are Shrines and Altars of Saints and Angels, by whoſe Interceſſion we may obtain our requeſts of God. When ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances Saints and Angels to the Office of Mediators and Interceſſors in Heaven, this contradicts the Type of One High Preiſt, who alone might enter into the Holy of Holies, which was a type of Heaven; for there is ſome difference between having one Mediator in Heaven, (and there can be no more under the Goſpel to anſwer to the Typical High Prieſt under the Law) and having a hundred Mediators in Heaven together with our Typical High Prieſt. To have a Mediator of pure Interceſſion in Heaven, who never offered any Sacrifice for us, cannot anſwer to the High Prieſt under the Law, who could not enter into the Holy of Holies without the blood of ſacrifice. The High Prieſts entering but once a year into the Holy of Holies, which was ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of Chriſts entering once into Heaven to interceed for us, cannot be reconciled with a new ſucceſſion of Mediators, as often as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> pleaſes to canonize them. So that either the Law was not typical of the ſtate of the Goſpel, or the Worſhip of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which is ſo contrary to all the types and figures of the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, I ſhall add but one thing more; that Chriſt and his Apoſtles have made no alteration in the object of the worſhip, appears from hence, that <hi>de facto</hi> there is no ſuch Law in the Goſpel for the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides the One ſupreme God. There is a great deal againſt it, as <hi>I</hi> have already ſhewn; but if there had been nothing againſt it, it had been argument enough againſt any ſuch alteration, that there is no expreſs poſitive Law for it. The force of which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not conſiſt meerly in the ſilence of the Goſpel, that there is nothing ſaid for it, (which the moſt Learned Advocates of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> readily grant, and give their reaſons, ſuch as they are, why this was not done, why we are not directed to pray to Saints and Angels, and Images, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but the argument lies in this, that there can be no alteration made in the object of worſhip without an expreſs Law, and therefore there is no alteration made becauſe there is no ſuch Law in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>The Jews were expreſly commanded to worſhip no other Beeing, but the Lord Jehovah as I have already proved, which Law appropriates all the acts of Religious worſhip to one God; and therefore all thoſe who were under the obligation of this Law (as to be ſure all natural Jews were) could not without the guilt of Idolatry give any Religious worſhip to any other Beeing, till this Law were expreſly repeated, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98824:103"/> expreſs leave given to worſhip ſome other Divine Beeings beſides the Supreme God; ſo that at leaſt our Saviour himſelf, while he was on Earth and ſubject to the Law, and his Apoſtles, and all believing Jews were oblidged by this Law to worſhip none but God, unleſs we can ſhew where Chriſt by his Legiſlative Authority, or his Apoſtles by Commiſſion from him, have expreſly repealed this Law; nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unleſs we can ſhew, that Chriſt himſelf repealed this Law, and taught the worſhip of Saints and Angels, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20</note> the Apoſtles themſelves could have no authority to do it, for their Commiſſion was only to teach what Chriſt had commanded them, which though it does not extend to matters of order and diſcipline, and the external circumſtances of worſhip, yet it does as to all eſſentials of Faith and worſhip and I think the right object of Worſhip is the moſt eſſential thing in Religious Worship.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appears, that at leaſt all the Jewish Chriſtians in the Apoſtles dayes, and all ſucceeding Ages to this day, cannot worship Saints and Angels without Idolatry, becauſe the Law, which was given to them, and never yet repealed, commands them to worſhip none but God; and if Gentile Converts were received into the Jewiſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church (and Chriſt has but one Church of Jews and Gentiles) they muſt alſo be oblidged by all thoſe Laws, which were then, and are ſtill obligatory to all believing Jews, and therefore Gentile as well as Jewiſh Chriſtians, are ſtill bound to worſhip none but God.</p>
                     <p>Now I think I need not prove, that an expreſs Law can be repealed onely by an expreſs Law. That Law which commands us to worſhip God, and him only, muſt continue in full force, till GOD do as expreſly declare, that he allows us to pay ſome degree of Religious Worſhip to other Beeings beſides himſelf: When a Law-giver has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his will and pleaſure by a Law, it is not fit that Subjects ſhould be allowed to gueſs at his mind, and diſpute away an expreſs Law by ſome ſurmiſes and conſequences, how probable ſoever they may appear; for at this rate a Law ſignifies nothing, if we may gueſs at the will of our Law-giver, without and againſt an expreſs Law. And yet none of the Advocates of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though they are not uſually guilty of too much modeſty) ever had the confidence to pretend an expreſs Law for the worſhip of Saints and Angels, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and though they ſometimes alledge Scripture to prove this by, yet they do not pretend that they are direct proofs, but only attempt to prove ſome other Doctrines from Scripture, from which they think they may prove by ſome probable conſequences that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where plainly teaches, nay the contrary to which is expreſly taught in the Scripture. And if this may be allow'd, I know no law of God ſo plain and expreſs, but a witty man may find wayes to eſcape the obligation of it. This is a conſideration of great moment, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98824:104"/> therefore I ſhall diſcourſe more particularly of it.</p>
                     <p>The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſly commands us to worſhip GOD, and him only; Our Saviour Chriſt owns and confirms the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Law in the Goſpel; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Law, gives Religious Worſhip to Creatures, the queſtion then is, how ſhe avoids the force of this Law ſince it is no where expreſly repealed, and ſhe does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it is. Now the Patrons of Creature-worſhip thinks to juſtifie themſelves from the breach of this Law, theſe three ways. 1.

                     <p>1. By conſequences drawn, as they pretend, from other Scripture-Doctrines; and I ſhall diſcourſe this with a particular reference to the Invocation of Saints. For when they would prove the lawfulneſs of praying to Saints, they alledge no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proof of this from Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; but becauſe they muſt make a ſhew of ſaying ſomething from Scripture, when they are to deal with ſuch Hereticks as will be ſatisfied with no leſs autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they endeavour to prove ſomething elſe from Scripture, from whence they think by an eaſie conſequence, they can prove the lawfulneſs of praying to Saints.</p>
                     <p>Thus they very eaſily prove, that we may and ought to pray for one another, and to deſire each others prayers while we are on Earth; and from hence they preſently conclude, that we may as lawfully pray to Saints in Heaven to pray for us, as beg and deſire their prayers, while they are one Earth.</p>
                     <p>And to confirm this, they endeavour to prove, that ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Saints, whoſe merits are very great, do directly aſcend up into Heaven unto the immediate preſence of God, and a participation of his Glory; and hence they conclude, that they have authority and power to help us and to intercede for us, and that they are ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above us in this mortal ſtate, that they deſerve ſome kind of Religious Honour and Worſhip from us, as being <hi>Dii per participatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> Gods by participation, that is, by partaking in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Glory by their advancement to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And if after all this they can prove, that the Saints in Heaven do pray and intercede for us on Earth, they think the demonſtration is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

Suppoſe we ſhould grant them, that the Saints are received into Heaven before the Reſurrection, and are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſt of all that Glory and Hapineſs, which they ſay they are; ſuppoſe we ſhould grant them, that by ſome means unknown to us, Saints and Angels are acquainted with all that we do and ſuffer in this world, hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that we muſt pray to Saints, though God has forbid it. For thoſe are powerful reaſons indeed, which can juſtifie Saint-worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the expreſs Law and declared Will of God. Could they firſt prove one of theſe three things: Either 1. that there is no ſuch Law againſt the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides God. Or 2. that this is not the ſenſe of the Law, that they muſt not pray to Saints or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that the Law, which forbids us to worſhip any Beeing but God, does not forbid the worſhip of Saints. Or 3. that though there was ſuch a Law, and this were the ſenſe of it, and this Law were never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally repealed by God, yet it diſappears of it ſelf, and oblidges no longer ſince the diſcovery ſuch reaſons as theſe for the worſhip of Saints and Angels. I ſay, could they prove any thing of this in the firſt place, then there would be as much reaſon for the worſhip of Saints, as there is ſtrength and validity in their Arguments; but no reaſon can take place againſt an expreſs Law, till it be as expreſly repealed. For,</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:98824:105"/>2. If an expreſs Law may be diſobeyed, as often as men fancy they ſee reaſon to do what the Law forbids, this overthrows the whole authority of making Laws, and makes every Subject a Judge, whither the Laws of a Soveraign Prince ſhall be obeyed or not. At this rate he has the greateſt authority, who has the beſt reaſon; and ſince every man believes his own reaſon to be beſt, every man is the Soveraign Lord of his own actions. It is to be preſumed, that no Prince makes a Law, but what he apprehends ſome reaſon for, and to oppoſe any mans private reaſon againſt a Law. is to ſet up a private mans reaſon againſt the publick reaſon of government: and yet it is much worſe to oppoſe our reaſon againſt a Divine Law, which is to oppoſe the reaſon of Creatures againſt the reaſon of God, unleſs we will ſay, that GOD makes Laws without reaſon, and thoſe who can believe that, may as eaſily imagine, that God will expect that thoſe Laws he makes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, ſhould be obeyed without reaſon alſo, and then to be ſure all their reaſons cannot repeal a Law, nor juſtifie them in the breach of it. It becomes every Creature to believe the will of God to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igheſt reaſon, and therefore when God has declared his will by an expreſs Law, while this Law continues in force, (as it muſt do, till it be as expreſly repealed) it is an impudent thing to urge our reaſons againſt the obligations of it. So that ſince God has expreſly forbid us to worſhip any Beeing beſides himſelf, unleſs we can prove, that God has repealed this Law, it will never juſtifie the worſhip of Saints and Angels, though we could by the plaineſt and eaſieſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments prove to the conviction of all Mankind, that Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are very fit objects of our Religious Worſhip, and that it is no diminution to the glory of God to pay ſome degree of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Eſpecially, when the matter of the Law is ſuch, that whatever reaſons may be pretended on one ſide or the other, it moſt ſtill be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be wholly at the will and pleaſure of the Law-giver, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch fide he will chooſe. As for inſtance, ſuppoſe there were no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary reaſon againſt the worſhip of Saints and Angels, yet there is no natural and neceſſary reaſon for it neither, and therefore God may either allow or forbid it, as he himſelf pleaſes, without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning any reaſon why he does either. And when it appears that God might forbid it if he pleaſes, and that he has actually forbid it by an expreſs Law, it is time to leave off reaſoning about it: natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can give us no aſſurance of any thing, which it cannot prove to be neceſſary, whatever in the nature and reaſon of things may be, or may not be, can never be proved either to be, or not to be, by meer reaſon; for it is a contradiction to ſay, that there is no neceſſary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſuch a thing ſhould be, and yet that I can prove by reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it muſt be, which ſuppoſes, that there is a neceſſary reaſon, why it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98824:105"/> ſhould be; for I cannot prove, that it muſt be, unleſs I can prove that it moſt neceſſarily be; that is, that there is a neceſſary reaſon, why it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>To apply this then to our preſent Caſe. The Law expreſly forbids us to worſhip any other Beeing beſides the ſupreme God, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prays to Saints and Angels and Images. which is an eſſential part of Divine Worſhip; and without ever attempting to prove this Law to be repealed, ſhe juſtifies her worſhip by ſuch reaſons and conſequences, as <hi>I</hi> have now cited from their moſt celebrated Doctors, and ſome of which are the principles, whereon the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> founds their praying to Saints and Angels. I ask then, whither theſe arguments, whereby they endeavour to juſtifie the worſhip of Saints and Angels, prove that we muſt worſhip them, that ſuch worſhip is their natural right, and our duty. No, this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not own: the moſt the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſayes, is, that it is <hi>bonum &amp; utile,</hi> good &amp; profitable to do it; but, ſay I, if they do not prove it to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they prove nothing; for if Saints and Angels have not a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right to our worſhip though we ſhould ſuppoſe them to be very fit objects of ſome degrees of worſhip, yet it is at Gods choice, whither he will allow it or not, and they can challenge no worſhip, and we muſt give none, if God forbids it; and therefore ſince God has forbid the worſhip of any Beeing, but himſelf (and therefore of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Saints and Angels) by an expreſs Law; and it no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, where or when, or in what manner this Law was repealed, a hundred ſuch arguments as theſe cannot prove it lawful to worſhip Saints and Angels againſt an expreſs Law not to do it. Though we ſhould grant that God, if he pleaſed, might allow us to worſhip Saints and Angels, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, without any diminution of his own Glory, which is the moſt that all their arguments can pretend to prove, yet it does not hence follow, that we may worſhip them, when God by an expreſs Law has declared, that he will not allow it. No arguments nor conſequences can prove, that God allows us to do that, which by an expreſs Law he has forbid us to do. No reaſon can prove that to be Gods will, which he has publickly declared in his Law to be againſt his will.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That no reaſon or arguments can abſolve us from our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any expreſs Law, till it be as expreſly repealed, appears from this, that our obligation to obedience does not depend meerly upon the reaſon of the Law, but upon the authority of the Law-giver, and therefore though the reaſon of the Law ſhould ceaſe, yet while it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the ſame authority, it oblidges ſtill, Thus I am ſure, it is in humane Laws, and it is very fiting it ſhould be ſo; meer reaſon cannot make a Law, for then every thing which is reaſonable, would be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty; that which is reaſonable may be fit matter for a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98824:106"/> Law, but it is the authority of the Law-giver which makes the Law, and the ſame authority which at firſt made it a Law, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it to be a Law while the authority laſts, though the particular reaſon for which it was enacted into a Law, may ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>So that though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could prove, that there is no reaſon now againſt the worſhip of Saints and Angels, that all thoſe reaſons for which God forbad the Jews to worſhip any one but himſelf, were now ceaſed; yet till the Law be repealed too, it is utterly unlawful to worſhip any Beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Supreme God, and yet this is the moſt that all their reaſonings come to, that there is not the ſame reaſon for this Law under the State of the Goſpel, that there was under the Jewiſh Oeconomy.</p>
                     <p>They ſuppoſe, that God forbad the Jews to worſhip any one but himſelf, becauſe they were in great danger of falling into Pagan Idolatries, and worſhipping the Gods of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and other Neighbour-Nations, and that this was the caſe alſo of the Chriſtian Church at the firſt planting of the Goſpel; but now there is no danger of worſhipping falſe Gods, we may very ſecurely worſhip the Friends and Favourites of God.</p>
                     <p>They ſuppoſe, that all the ancient Patriarchs who lived before the Reſurrection of Chriſt, were not received into Heaven, and therefore not being in a ſtate of Bliſs and Glory themſelves, were not yet capable of Divine Honours, could neither know our Prayers, nor intercede for us. But now at laſt ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints and Martyrs aſcend directly into Heaven, and are the <hi>Beati,</hi> advanced to ſuch a ſtate of Happineſs and Glory; that they are fit objects of Religious Worſhip, and are ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Court of Heaven; that God denies them nothing which they ask; and ſo tender and eompaſſionate to us, that they readily undertake our Cauſe, and intercede for us, and therefore it is very good and profitable now to invoke their aid and aſſiſtance by ſolemn and devout Prayers.</p>
                     <p>And though the learndeſt men among them are put to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſhifts to prove the leaſt part of all this; yet let us for argument-ſake, ſuppoſe all this to be true, that things are mightily changed ſince the making of this Law, and that there is not the ſame reaſon now to confine all Religious Worſhip to God alone, that there was in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from hence, that therefore we may now worſhip Saints and Angels, notwithſtanding this Law which forbids it? by no means, unleſs they can prove that the Law is repealed too, as well as the reaſon ceaſed: Here is the authority of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98824:106"/> Law-giver ſtill, though we ſhould ſupoſe, that we had loſt the reaſon of the Law; till the Law is as expreſly repealed as it was given, it is God Will ſtill, and that is reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bind the Law upon us, though other reaſons fail. The reaſon (if we ſpeak of ſuch reaſons as theſe, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſigns, for it is a different caſe, if we ſpeak of eternal and neceſſary reaſon, which is nothing elſe but the eternal and immutable nature and will of God. which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Law) did not make the Law, and the change of the reaſon cannot repeal it. And ſince we ſee, that God has not repealed this Law, we rather ought to conclude, that we are miſtaken in the reaſons, for which God made this Law, or that there are other reaſons, which we know not of, for which he continues it: we may indeed reaſonably ſuppoſe, that God will repeal a Law, when the reaſons, for which it was given, ceaſes, though earthly Princes may not alwayes do ſo; but ſtill the Law binds till it be repealed; and it is more reaſonable to conclude, that the reaſon of the Law continues, while we ſee God does not repeal it, then firſt to perſwade our ſelves, that the reaſon of Law is changed, and thence infer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and abrogation of the Law, when we ſee no ſuch thing done.</p>
                     <p n="5">5, That theſe arguments which the Roman Doctors urge, to juſtifie their worſhip of Saints and Angels, are of no force to repeal that Law, which forbids the worſhip of any other Beeing beſides the Supreme God, appears from this, that they had no force in them to prevent the making of this Law, and therefore much leſs can they repeal it now it is made: The reaſons which they uſe, had the ſame force then, which they have now, and if notwithſtanding all the reaſons, God though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> fit to forbid the worſhip of all Created Beings, it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to imagine, that theſe reaſons ſhould ſuperſede the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Law, which is made in contradiction to all ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings: as to ſhew this briefly.</p>
                     <p>They prove, that we may pray to Saints and Angels to pray for us, becauſe we may deſire good men on earth to pray for us. Now ſuppoſe we could not aſſign the difference between praying to Saints in Heaven, and deſiring the prayers of Saints on earth, yet I would deſire to know, whither good men did not pray for one another, and deſire each others prayers, before and after God gave this Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which forbids the Religious worſhip and invocation of any other Beeing but himſelf: if good men did in all ages pray for one another, and deſire one anothers pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and God allowed and approved of this, then it ſeems God
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98824:107"/> did not think this a good reaſon for praying to Saints and Angels in Heaven, becauſe good men might beg each others prayers on earth, for if he had, he would not have made that Law, which forbids ſuch a Religious Invocation of any Creature. And if notwithſtanding this reaſon, which had as much force then, as it has now, God made and promulged this Law, this reaſon can never repeal it, nor diſſolve the obligation of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus if the Saints and Angels being in Heaven be a good reaſon why they ſhould be worſhipped, this was as good a reaſon at the giving of of the Law, as it is now; for thö we ſhould ſuppoſe with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Saints departed were not in Heaven then, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Angels were, and if their being in Heaven made them fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our worſhip, why did God ſo expreſly forbid it; and if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it then, when there was as much reaſon to allow the worſhip of of thoſe heavenly Inhabitants, as there is now, this argument cannot prove, but that God forbids it ſtill.</p>
                     <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the Interceſſion of Saints and Angels. The Papiſts ſuppoſe, that the Saints and Angels pray and intercede for us in Heaven, and obtain for, and convey many bleſſings to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good and profitable to pray to them, and to flie to their patronage; now though indeed they date the Interceſſion of Saints, (as they do their admiſſion into heaven) from the Reſurrection of our Saviour, yet there is as much evidence for the aids and interceſſions of Angels before and under the Law, as there is now; nay, I think ſomewhat more; for the government of the world was much more under the adminiſtration of Angels, in the time of the Law, then it is now; and yet notwithſtanding this, God did by an expreſs law forbid the worſhip of any being but himſelf, and therefore of theſe Angelical powers; who are ſomewhat ſuperiour to Saints in Heaven; and if this were no good reaſon againſt making this law, it can be no good reaſon to prove the abrogation of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. The next way they take to evade the obligation of this law of worſhipping God only, is by diſtinctions. As to name the chief of them.</p>
                     <p>They tell us, that this law is only oppoſed to the worſhip of falſe Gods, ſuch Gods as the Heathens worſhipped, not to the worſhip of Saints and Angels, who are the Friends and Favourites of God.</p>
                     <p>And then they diſtinguiſh about the nature of worſhip; they confeſs there is a worſhip which is peculiar to God, Supreme and Soveraign worſhip, which is peculiar to the Supreme Beeing, and this, for what reaſon I know not, they call <hi>Latria;</hi> but then there is an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of worſhip, which they call <hi>Dulia,</hi> which may be given to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98824:107"/> excellent Creatures, to Saints and Angels, who reign with Chriſt in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>They farther diſtinguiſh between abſolute and relative worſhip. Abſolute worſhip is, when we worſhip a Beeing for its ſelf, and thus God only is to be worſhipped; but relative worſhip is, when we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one Beeing out of reſpect to another, and thus we may worſhip Saints and Angels upon account of their relation to God.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhall have occaſion to examine theſe diſtinctions more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly hereafter, my buſineſs at preſent is to examine, how far theſe diſtinctions can juſtifie the worſhip of Saints and Angels againſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law, which commands us to worſhip God only. And I have three things to ſay on this argument. 1. That the letter of the law will admit of no ſuch diſtinctions as theſe. 2. That the Scripture no where allows any ſuch diſtinctions. And 3. That no diſtinctions can juſtifie our acting againſt the letter of a law, which have not the ſame authority which the Law has.</p>
                     <p>1. The letter of the Law will admit of no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions <note place="margin">Exod. 20</note> as theſe. The Law is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods before ME.</hi> The explication of this Law is, <note place="margin">Deut. 10 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, him ſhalt thou ſerve, and to him ſhalt thou cleave and ſwear by his name.</hi> Or as <note place="margin">Matth 4 10</note> our Saviour expounds it, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now theſe words do plainly exclude the worſhip of all other Beeings beſides the Supreme God: They exclude indeed the worſhip of all the <hi>Heathen Gods,</hi> which were at that time worſhipped in the world, but they are not confined to the worſhip of the Heathen Gods, nor meerly to the worſhip of thoſe Gods who were at that time worſhipped, but ſhould any new Gods ſtart up in after Ages, whither among Jews or Chriſtians, the words extend to all that are, and all that ever ſhall be worſhipped. <hi>Thou ſhalt have noe other Gods before Me,</hi> ſignifies, that we muſt worſhip no other Beeing but the Supreme God, for <hi>to have a God,</hi> is to give religious worſhip to ſome Beeing; as appears from that expoſition, which both <hi>Moſes</hi> and our Saviour Chriſt gives of it. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> For it is impoſſible to have any God beſides the Supreme God, in any other ſenſe then as we worſhip ſome other Beeing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Supreme God, with Divine honours; and whatever being we ſo worſhip, become our God, and therefore this Law forbids the worſhip of any Beeing, which is not God, be it Saint or Angel, or the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> how excellent and perfect Creatures ſoever they be, they are not our God, and therefore muſt not be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98824:108"/> If we muſt worſhip and ſerve God only, as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us, that we muſt worſhip no creature whatever it be, the worſhip of ſaints and Angels is as expreſly forbid by this Law, as the worſhip of the Heathen Gods, for that Law which commands us to worſhip GOD onely, excludes the worſhip of all Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be.</p>
                     <p>But may not the meaning of this Law be onely this: That we muſt not give ſupreme and ſoveraign worſhip to any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eeing, but the ſupreme GOD, but we may give an inferiour degree of worſhip to ſome excellent ſpirits, who under God have the care of us. And is not this plainly ſignified in the very letter of the Law, when it ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before me.</hi> For no other worſhip makes any Beeing a God, but that which is ſupreme and ſoveraign, peculiar and appropriate to the One ſupreme God; and therefore not to have any other Beeing for our God, is not to give Supreme and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Worſhip to it. Now what that worſhip is, which is peculiar and appropriate to the Supreme God, I ſhall diſcourſe particularly in the ſecond part; our preſent inquiry is, whither this Law makes any ſuch diſtinction. The Laws ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> Here is no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſupreme and ſubordinate worſhip; whatever is an Act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>p muſt be given to God onely. But the Law ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> and therefore it muſt ſignifie ſupreme and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign worſhip; for no other degree of worſhip makes a God. Did the Heathens then worſhip no inferiour gods? did thoſe who worſhipped ſo many ſeveral gods, look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pon them all as ſupreme and abſolute? or were they ſo ſenſeleſs as to give ſupreme and ſoveraign worſhip to inferiour Deities? or does not this Law forbid the worſhip of thoſe Gods, whom the Heathens worſhipped as inferiour Daemons, but only the worſhip of thoſe Gods, whom they accounted Supreme and Soveraign? If this Law forbids the worſhip of all Heathen Gods and it is certain, that they worſhipped a great many Gods, whom they did not account Supreme, then there can be no place for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction here, for ſuch an inferiour worſhip as makes an inferiour God, is as well forbid, as ſupreme and ſoveraign worſhip.</p>
                     <p>The Law ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before me:</hi> or beſides me; which as I obſerved before, does not exclude the worſhip of the ſupreme God, but forbids the worſhip of any other Beeing together with him. The meaning is not, Thou ſhalt not renounce my worſhip, for the worſhip of any other Gods, but thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, and no other God beſides me: now I would only ask this queſtion, whither a Jew who worſhipped the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be the Supreme God, could give ſupreme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to any other God? this is contrary to the ſenſe of all mankind,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98824:108"/> to worſhip him as Supreme, whom they do not believe to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. And therefore when God forbad them to joyn the worſhip of any other Gods with the worſhip of himſelf, he muſt forbid all kinds and degrees of worſhip, even the moſt inferiour worſhip, which the Heathens paid to their inferiour Deities.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, that God did indeed forbid all kinds and degrees of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be paid to the Heathen Gods, which were impure and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits, but ſtill it is lawful to pay inferiour worſhip to Saints and Angels, who are the friends of God. I anſwer, the Law makes no diſtinction between the worſhip of good and bad Spirits, and therefore as far as this Law is concerned, we muſt either deny this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour degrees of Worſhip to all, or grant it to all. If this Law does not forbid giving inferiour degrees of worſhip to other Beeings, then it does not forbid the inferiour worſhip of Heathen Gods; that may be faulty upon other accounts, but is no breach of this law; and then the Heathens were not guilty of Idolatry in worſhipping their inferiour D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with an inferiour worſhip. If this Law does forbid even this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree of worſhip, then it forbids the worſhip of good Spirits too, though with an inferiour worſhip, which transforms true Saints and Angels into falſe and fictitious Deities.</p>
                     <p>But I have another argument to prove, that this Law can have no reſpect to the different degrees of worſhip. The <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors themſelves grant, that the difference between ſupreme and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or inferiour worſhip, does not conſiſt in the outward Act, that all or moſt of the external Acts of worſhip may belong to both kinds, they except indeed Sacrifice, but contrary to the ſenſe of all men; for the Heathens offered Sacrifice to their inferiour Deities, as well as to the ſupreme; and there is no imaginable reaſon to be aſſigned why Sacrifice, as well as Prayer, may not be an act of inferiour, as well as of ſupreme worſhip. The difference then between ſupreme and inferiour worſhip, is only in the intention and devotion of the worſhippers, and no man can by the external act know whither this be ſupreme or inferiour worſhip. Now from hence <hi>I</hi> thus argue: if the worſhip forbidden by this Law be ſuch, as can be known by the external act, then this Law can have no regard to the degrees of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for the degrees of worſhip are not in the external acts, but in the mind of the worſhipper, which cannot be known by external acts. Now that the Law did forbid the external acts of worſhip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the intention of the worſhipper, appears in this, that this Idolatrous worſhip was to be puniſhed with death, and therefore it muſt be ſuch external Idolatry as falls under the cognizance of humane Judicatures. Had there been <note place="margin">Deutr. 13. 6 7. &amp;c.</note> any regard to the degrees of worſhip, no man could have been convicted of Idolatry by the external act, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98824:109"/> could not have been liable to puniſhment, unleſs he had confeſſed his intention of giving ſupreme worſhip to a falſe God, and ſo this Law of putting ſuch Idolaters to death had ſignified nothing, becauſe it had been impoſſible for them to convict any man of Idolatry, but by his own confeſſion: but when the external act which is viſible to all men, is ſufficient to convict any man of Idolatry, it is next to a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Law had no reſpect to the degrees, but to the acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>And that our Saviour in that Law, <hi>thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> had no regard to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of worſhip, I have already proved at large, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that diſtinction, he had not given a good anſwer to the Devils temptation.</p>
                     <p>Thus as for their diſtinction between abſolute and relative worſhip, that though we muſt not worſhip any Creature, the moſt excellent Saints and Angels, for themſelves, yet we may worſhip them upon account of that relation they have to God; that is, we may worſhip them for Gods ſake, though not for their own; <hi>I</hi> find no intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſuch diſtinction in the Law. We are there commanded to have no other Gods, to worſhip God and him only, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Saints and Angels from being the object of our worſhip, as well as Devils.</p>
                     <p>2. But poſſibly it may be ſaid; that though the Law takes no notice of ſuch diſtinctions, yet the Scripture in the explication of this Law may make allowances for it. Now in anſwer to this, I only deſire to know, where the Scripture has made any ſuch diſtinction between wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping good and evil Spirits, the enemies and Rivals, or the Friends of God, between ſupreme and ſubordinate, abſolute or relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>p; I can find no ſuch diſtinctions in Scripture, and I have a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial reaſon to believe no ſuch can be found, <hi>viz</hi> becauſe there was no occaſion for them. The Scripture no where allows us to give any kind of worſhip to any Creature, and therefore there was no need to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the kind and degrees of worſhip.</p>
                     <p>The moſt material thing that can be ſaid in this cauſe is this: that when the Scripture mentions this Law of worſhipping One God, it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it to the worſhip of the falſe Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; from whence ſome may conclude, that God <note place="margin">Deut 6. 13. 14 Deut 13. 7.</note> forbade the worſhip only of theſe falſe Gods. But we muſt conſider, that the Law is conceived in ſuch general terms, as to exclude the worſhip of all Beeings beſides the Supreme God; but it could not be thought, that God ſhould at that time immediately apply this Law againſt the worſhip of any other Beeings, but thoſe which were at that time worſhipped in the world. If God gives a Law, which forbids the worſhip of any
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98824:109"/> Beeings beſides himſelf; and particularly applies this Law to prohibite the worſhip of all thoſe Gods which were then worſhipped in the world, will any one in theirs wits hence conclude, that if the folly and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of men ſhould ſet up a new race and generation of Gods in after ages, that the worſhip of theſe new Gods is not as well forbidden by this general Law, as the worſhip of thoſe gods which were worſhip'd at that time when this Law was given? If this were true, poſſibly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was not guilty of Idolatry; for moſt, if not all of their Gods might be of a later date then the giving the Law.</p>
                     <p>3. Now ſince no ſuch diſtinctions as theſe appear in Scripture, it is impoſſible they ſhould juſtifie the worſhip of Saints and Angels; which is ſo expreſly forbidden by the Law, if we will acknowledge them to be diſtinct Beeings from the Supreme God; for if they are not the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme GOD, we muſt not worſhip them, for we muſt worſhip none but God. No diſtinctions can juſtifie us in this caſe, but ſuch as GOD himſelf makes; for otherwiſe it were eaſie to diſtinguiſh away any Law of God. Humane Laws will admit of no diſtinctions, but ſuch as they make themſelves; for a diſtinction does either confine and ſtreighten, or enlarge the Law, and he who has power to diſtinguiſh upon a Law, has ſo far power to make it. If the Law ſays, that we ſhall worſhip no other Beeing beſides God, and we have power, if we have but wit enough, to invent ſome new diſtinctions, between the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of good and bad ſpirits, between Supreme and Subordinate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and relative worſhip; this makes a new Law of it; for it is one thing to ſay thou ſhalt worſhip GOD only, and quite contrary to ſay, thou ſhalt worſhip God only and good Spirits, God with a ſupreme and abſolute, good Spirits with a ſubordinate and relative worſhip. This I think is ſufficient to ſhew, that we muſt admit of no diſtinctions upon a Divine Law, but what the Scripture it ſelf owns, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince thoſe diſtinctions, with which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> juſtifies her worſhip of Saints and Angels, are no where to be found in Scripture, they have no authority againſt an expreſs Law.</p>
                     <p>3. The next courſe the Papiſts take to juſtifie their Creature-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in contradiction to that Law, which expreſly commands us to worſhip none but God, is an appeal to ſuch authorities, as they think ſufficient to decide this matter.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſhall not ſay much to this, for I believe all Mankind will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that no Authority leſs then Divine, can repeal a Divine Law; and therefore unleſs God himſelf, or ſuch perſons as act by a Divine Authority, have repealed this Law, no other Authority can do it. That Chriſt and his Apoſtles have not repealed this Law, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, that the whole Church in after Ages had any Authority to repeal this Law, I deſire them to prove.</p>
                     <p>For the authority of the Church, as to the eſſentials of Faith and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98824:110"/> Worſhip, is not the authority of Law-givers, but of Witneſſes, The Church never pretended in former Ages to make or to repeal any Divine Laws, but to declare and teſtifie what the belief and practice of the Primitive and Apoſtolick Churches was; and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to think, that they ſhould have any ſuch Authority; for then Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached the Goſpel to little purpoſe, if it were in the power of the Church to make a new Goſpel of it when they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>But indeed could it appear, that the Apoſtles did teach the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of that Age, and the Church in thoſe Ages, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded the Apoſtles, did practiſe the worſhip of Saints and Angels, we ſhould have reaſon to ſuſpect, that we, and not they, are miſtaken in the ſenſe of that Law, which commands us to worſhip none but God.</p>
                     <p>But then none can be admitted as competent witneſſes of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but thoſe who did immediately ſucceed the Apoſtles, or converſed with Apoſtolical men and Churches. And thanks be to God, there is no appearance of creature-worſhip in thoſe Ages, we dare appeal to the teſtimony of Fathers and Councils for above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; and thoſe who come after, come a little too late to be witneſſes of what was done in the Apoſtolick Churches: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when all the intermediate Ages knew nothing of it.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That theſe Fathers came too late to be witneſſes of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical practice, which they could know no otherwiſe, then we might know it, if there had been any ſuch thing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the teſtimony and practice of the Church, from the Apoſtles till that time: This was no where pretended by them, that the Invocation of Saints had been the practice of the Catholick Church in all ages, and they could have no proof of this, unleſs they had better Records of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98824:110"/> former times, then we have at this day, and ſuch as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted all the Records which we now have of the Apoſtolick and Primitive Churches, and I believe few men will be ſo hardy, as to aſſert this; and me thinks there ſhould be as few, who are ſo credulous as to believe it, and <hi>I</hi> am ſure, there is no man living who is able to prove it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nay, the particular ſayings of theſe Fathers, by which the Romaniſts prove the Invocation of Saints, do not prove, that it was the Judgement and practice of the Church of that age. They no where ſay, that it was, and it does not appear to be ſo by any other Records. Let them ſhew me any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil before, or in thoſe times, when theſe Fathers lived, that is in the fourth Century, which decreed the worſhip of Saints and Angels. Let them produce any publick offices of Religion in in thoſe dayes, which allows this worſhip; and if no ſuch thing appears, thoſe men muſt be very well prepared to believe this, who will without any other evidence judge of the practice of the Church, only from ſome extravagant ſlights of Poets and Orators: and if even in thoſe dayes, the worſhip of Saints was not received into the publick offices of the Church, methinks we may as well live without it ſtill, and they muſt either grant, that theſe Fathers, whoſe authority they alledge, mean'd no ſuch thing by theſe Rhetorical flouriſhes, as they extract out of them, or elſe that they introduced a new and unknown worſhip into the Chriſtian Church; and then let them prove, that ſome few Fathers of the fourth Century, without the publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church had authority enough of their own to change the object of worſhip, contrary as the Church in former Ages believed, to an expreſs Divine Law, which commands us to worſhip none but God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nay, I farther obſerve, that theſe Fathers, whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is urged for the invocation of Saints by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do no where dogmatically and poſitively aſſert the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Praying to Saints and Angels, and many Fathers of the ſame Age do poſitively deny the lawfulneſs of it, which is a plain argument, that it was not the judgement and practice of the Church of that Age, and a good reaſonable preſumption that theſe Fathers never intended any ſuch thing in what they ſaid, how liable ſoever their words may be to be expounded to ſuch a ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>From all which we may perceive, what an evident repugnancy there is betwixt the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome</hi> in the matter before us: And therefore for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Caſe and diſcerning which is in the Right, and which in the Wrong; I ſhall diſcourſe of it in the following order.</p>

                     <p>TOward the fixing the ſenſe of this Phraſe, we are to obſerve, 1. That there is the <hi>Vulgar Tongue</hi> of a Country, which is univerſally underſtood by the Natives of what rank or quality ſoever. Such was the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue formerly in <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuch now is <hi>Engliſh</hi> with us.</p>
                     <p>Before we diſmiſs this, it is to be farther conſidered,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there are different D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>alects or waves of expreſſing and pronouncing the ſame Tongue: which differences of Words,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98824:113"/> or pronounciation do not ſo alter the Tongue, but that throughout under all theſe variations it agrees in much more then it differs; ſo that he that ſpeaks the one, is generally underſtood by him that that uſeth the other. Such anciently were the different Dialects of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue: well known to the learned: And ſuch are the Northern, Southren and Weſtern wayes of ſpeaking amongſt our ſelves in this Nation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where there are theſe different Dialects, there generally is one way of ſpeaking, which either from the eloquence, or faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onableneſs of it, ſo far prevails, as to be the Standard of the Tongue, and to be uſed in Writing Books, Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is underſtood by all. Such <hi>I</hi> conceive was anciently that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the common Dialect</hi> in <hi>Greek:</hi> And of the like kind is that which is ſpoken in and about the court, and by Scholars and perſons of a liberal education amongſt us; and elſewhere.</p>

                     <p>II. There is a <hi>Common Tongue,</hi> which though not the Mother or National Tongue, is however with that commonly and generally underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was anciently in many places with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> The former of which, was once the <hi>common Tongue</hi> of a great part of the then known World, and continued ſo to be from the time of <hi>Cicero,</hi> to that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> for the ſpace that is of 400.

                     <p>III. There is a <hi>Learned Tongue,</hi> which though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt the Learned, yet they being few in compariſon of the Vulgar, that underſtand it not, it cannot be called <hi>a common Tongue:</hi> Such are <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> now.</p>
                     <p>IV. Their is a Tongue underſtood and ſpoken by none in a Nation, or ſo few, as are next to none; and which if uſed in Divine Offices would be wholly unintelligible. Such are <hi>Perſick</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> with us,</p>
                     <p>The uſe of all this niceneſs, is partly to clear the ſtate of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partly to prevent many of the Objections which the caſe is cumbred with: And without the obſerving of which, the Diſpute will be turned from the point that is contraverted, to that which is not. As it happens for the moſt part among thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that undertake the management of this Cauſe; who do either diſtinguiſh where they are not to diſtinguiſh, or do not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh where they ſhould diſtinguiſh. For ſometimes they oppoſe the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of a Tongue to that Tongue of which they are the Dialects: At other times they oppoſe the common Tongue to the Vulgar: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they confound the Learned Tongue with the common: And then again oppoſe the learned and utterly unknown, as if theſe two were of as different kinds as known and unknown.</p>

They endeavour to make it out by ſhewing how unfit it is to think of Tranſlating, and how unreaſonable it is to expect they ſhould be tranſlated into the ſeveral Dialects of each Tongue? Would they farther ſhew that the Divine Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not of old ſo tranſlated? they attempt to prove it from their not having been tranſlated? into different Dialects. As if the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of a Tongue differed as much from each other, and all from the main Tongue of a Nation, as a learned Tongue differs from the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98824:114"/> Vulgar. which is (to ſpeak charitably) for want of obſerving, that the Dialects are but ſeveral modes of ſpeaking the ſame Tongue; and that ordinarily there is ſome common Standard, which (as I have ſaid) over-rules the reſt, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If we would inquire into the lawfulneſs of ſuch things as appertain to Divine Worſhip, we muſt apply our ſelves to the Holy Scripture; being in matters of that nature to determine of Right and Wrong, Lawful and Unlawful, according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Commands, and Prohibitions of it. If we would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about their Expedience, we muſt conſider the Nature, Ends, and Uſe of what we inquire about. This therefore is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per method for the Reſolution of the foregoing Queſtion: But becauſe the Apoſtle (in his Diſcourſe upon this Subject, 1. <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 14.) doth argue from the ends and uſe of the ſeveral Offices belonging to Divine Worſhip, and becauſe the like Order may give ſome light and force to what follows; I ſhall firſt of all,</p>

For it is not God but Man that is immediately reſpected in the Words (ſince there is no more need of Words to GOD, then of Words that are vulgarly underſtood) and ſo it is not for him but Man, that this Tongue or that, or indeed that any Tongue at all is uſed.

                     <p>1. The Proteſtants argue in general, that the End of Divine Offices is for the Edification, Inſtruction and Conſolation of the people; but theſe Ends cannot be attained in a Tongue not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them.</p>
                     <p>To this it is replyed, <q>That the Propoſition is falſe, becauſe the chief end of Divine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">

                     <p>2. The Proteſtants argue in particular that there can no profit proceed to the Church from Prayers not underſtood.</p>
                     <p>To this it is anſwered, <q>That it is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the prayer of the Church is not made to <note place="margin">

                     <p>But (1) if this argument hold, it will prove that which they do decline, and be a reaſon as well for private as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers in an unknown Tongue.

For both are ſuppoſed; for that we pray, reſpects GOD, but that we ſpeak in publick prayer reſpects the Church: And though the principal End (as they call it) be regarded, and it be an Honour and worſhip given to GOD: Yet if the leſs principal be neglected, and the Service is not ordered to the encreaſe of Faith, Love and Devotion in thoſe that offer it (as it cannot be where the Words, and ſo the things prayed for in thoſe Words, are not underſtood) it makes the Honour, ſaid to be given to God, next to none; And it is much at one, whither there was no end at all propounded in Worſhip, or ſuch an End, as through a defect in it ſhall render the ſervice no better in it ſelf, and no more acceptable to GOD, then if there were none.

                        <hi>contain great Inſtruction for the Faithful.</hi> Or elſe he muſt ſay that the means of Inſtruction may be rendred ineffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual at the pleaſure of the Church, (as it is granted it is by being in an unknown Tongue) and yet neither the Church be blamed, nor the Inſtitution of ſuch means for ſuch an End be diſparaged, nor the Souls of Men receive any damage by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98824:118"/> the want of that Inſtruction, and the Means appointed for it. So that as far as Inſtruction is an end, and the Divine Service is a means for that Eend, it is granted that the keeping it in an Unknown Tongue doth defeat that end: For he ſaith, <hi>That the Minds of common people are not inſtructed by Service in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue.</hi> And now what an uſurpation is this upon God, to withhold that means that he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or to defeat the Means of that End that he hath appointed it for? What an injury to the Souls of Men? And how much acceſſory muſt that Church be to the Miſcarriage and Damnation of ſuch as periſh for want of that knowledge and Inſtruction the Service and Offices of the Church do contain, and they might receive from it.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe that end be loſt, <hi>and the peoples Minds be not inſtructed, yet their Affections are not without the benefit of it.</hi> This is ſpoken with a Caution and Reſervation becoming one that ſaw farther into the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of what he ſaid, then he cared to own. He ſaith at large, <hi>their Affections are not without the benefit of it:</hi> But how the Affections could be benefited, without the Mind is inſtructed; or what the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is which the Affections are not without, he is ſparing to tell us. But however the Rhemiſts advance a little farther; for they with no little confidence do deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <note place="margin">

The reſolution of which depends upon the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul of Man, and the ſeveral faculties of it.</p>
                     <p>Concerning which it ſhall ſuffice to obſerve,</p>
                     <p>1. That in all reaſonable and deliberate Acts, there is more or leſs ſo neceſſary a concurrance of the prime faculties of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Underſtanding, Will and Affections, that none of them can be ſaid to be excluded. 2. That in all ſuch Acts if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be not the leading faculty, and of ſuch influence, that the others cannot act without it (which muſt be ſuppoſed, for how can a perſon affect or chooſe what he doth not know?) Yet without that, the acts cannot be termed reaſonable. <hi>So Caſſiodore, No body doth any thing wiſely which he doth not underſtand.</hi> 3. That in the Acts of Religion, the preſence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now to ſay, <hi>That the affections are not without</hi>

                     <p>But this kind of Doctrine is only to ſerve a turn, being fitted to thoſe that are fitted for it, and to whom nothing can be abſurd, which ſome Men ſay: For there are thoſe amongſt them cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it; and do determine otherwiſe. So <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuit, <hi>If any one prayes privately, and the things prayed for are not underſtood by by him, he waſtes his time: So he that ſpeaketh publickly in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, which others do not underſtand,</hi>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98824:119"/> others receive none. This the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth acknowledge, when it declares, (as aboveſaid) <hi>It ſeems not expedient to the Fathers, That the Maſs be celebrated in the Vulgar Tongue:</hi> And preſently adds, <hi>Leſt the Sheep of Chriſt ſhould hunger, and when the little ones ask bread, there is none to break to them; the Holy Synod com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all that have the care of Souls, frequently,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>to expound ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of it.</hi> So that they grant without Explication, the Faithful may hunger and be without profit, for what need would there be of expoſition, if the people may be as devout without it as with it? I ſhall conclude this with that of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> 
                        <q>We ought to underſtand, that we may ſing with humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note place="margin">

For both Parrots, and Crows, and Pies, and the like; are often taught by Men to pronounce what they do not know—But to ſing with underſtanding is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</q> by the Divine Will to mankind. So that according to him, if we ſet aſide the Underſtanding, the Parrot of the Cardinal <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,</hi> had it been taught the LORD'S Prayer, or other Forms of Devotion, as well as the Creed, <note place="margin">

Since whatever Affection and Devotion is pretended to without Knowledge, is like <hi>a Viſion of a mans own Heart,</hi> and not of <note place="margin">

                     <p>But that we may not think this Aſſertion of theirs, (that <hi>there may be profit without underſtanding, and Devotion without knowledge)</hi> to be unreaſonable, they both produce Experience, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo to give a rational account of it. The former is appealed to by the Rhemiſts; <q>As for <note place="margin">

                     <p>III. That no more is neceſſary; and though they are to ask ſpecial things of God, yet it is not needful to underſtand what, or how, or when, or if at all they are eſpecially prayed for. For then they would underſtand the ſpecials.</p>
                     <p>But now this ſtate of the Caſe will not ſolve the Point. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This is contrary to the Apoſtle, who doth maintain, that as the publick Service of God is to be ordered ſo, as to be for edification of the Church; ſo the Church cannot be edified, without the Offices are adminiſtred in a Tongue that ſhall as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9, 16.</note> and particularly ſignifie and point to the thing thereby to be expreſſed, as a Trumpet or other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth give notice by a diſtinction of Sounds, when to advance or retreat, when to fight and when to forbear.

He may be all the while in a poſture of contradiction to the Church, and have his diſpoſitions ſo little ſuted to the ſolemnities of it, that the Prieſts may ſay to ſuch, with ſome little variation, in the Words of the Goſpel, <hi>We have piped unto you, and ye have mourned; we have mourned unto you, and ye have daunced.</hi> So that unleſs they will ſay, There are no need of particular diſpoſitions, according to the kinds, and ſpecial uſes of the Offices of Religion, they muſt ſay, That Service in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, is not for the edification of the Church.

If this were true, That a confuſed general knowledge is ſufficient, yet this will not help them, or juſtifie them in the uſe of an Unknown Tongue: For even the general knowledge they pretend to, doth not proceed from the Tongue (for that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not) but is obtained ſome other way that is by ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Poſtures, ſome particular Words and Phraſes, ſome Ceremon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall make this clear by an inſtance or two. Not many years ſince, in a certain City of <hi>Brabant,</hi> there was for ornament a large Statue erected at a conduit near the Market-place, to which the Country People as they paſſed to and fro, did often pay their Devotions (not diſcerning any differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>at (to prevent any ſuch miſtake for the future) it was by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand transformed into a little Boy, with a change alſo of the poſture. Now if we would enquire into this Devotion, it is much what the ſame we are diſcourſing of. There wanted not an inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that inclined the people to it; there wanted not outward expreſſions, for they bowed befor it, kiſſed the Feet of it, ſaid their <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> &amp;c. before it, and all with as much Devotion, as if it had been the Image of S. <hi>Roch,</hi> or S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> or S. <hi>Michael</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (the Protector and Patron of the place). And yet all this being applied to a common, and not a religious Object, and being only the Fruit of Imagination and not of Inſtruction, it deſerved another name then Devotion, and was not ſo accounted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And now, why what is given, ſuppoſe to a right Object, but without knowledge, ſhould not be equivalent to the other, that was intended to a right, but was addreſſed, by miſtake, to a wrong, is not eaſie to diſcern? Farthermore, Let us ſuppoſe a Caſe, A perſon being before hand poſſeſſed with a report of certain perſons met together upon a deſign of Conjuration, comes to the place, and finds the Company there aſſembled; and hearing all that they ſay, performed in a Language he underſtands not, he preſently is ſeaſed with a pannick fear, and is every moment in expectation of the foul Fiends's appearance at their ſummons, but is all this while abuſed, and under a miſtake, for the perſons were there met for Religious worſhip, and ſo the ground of his fear imaginary. On the other hand, a perſon comes into a place, where he finds ſeveral met together, who uſing much the like poſtures as if they were at their Devotions, and alſo Words he underſtands not, but what for ought he knows are the ſame that are uſed in the Church ſervice, he falls upon his Knees, pulls out his beads, ſayes an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> or <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or what he has been uſed to in that kind. And now can there be any

Thoſe among them that do quit this, yet hold that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth not forbid a Tongue ſo unknown, as the <hi>Latin</hi> is now, in Divine Worſhip. And for this they offer ſeveral Arguments, which will be all comprehended, and I conceive cleared, by conſidering.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What is mean'd by the Unknown Tongue, which the Apoſtle condemns?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What by the Aſſemblies, in which ſuch an Unknown Tongue is forbid?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What by the Service uſed in theſe Aſſemblies?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. How far the Apoſtle's Prohibition is to be extended?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. As to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>They ſay, That the Tongues condemned were <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ledeſma, c. 26. Rhem. annot. p.</hi> 461.</note> miraculous and extraordinarily infuſed, but what they plead for is acquired and learn'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> But ſuppoſing the Tongues were miraculous yet what is this to the caſe in Hand, when they wee not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for being miraculous (for as ſuch they were Gifts from God and Signs to Men) but as they were abuſed, and uſed neither to the Glory of God, nor the Edification of the Church. And by parity of reaſon, every Unknown Tongue, as well what is acquired as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, is condemned alſo. The Miraculous Tongue was forbidden, when it did not profit, when it was a ſpeaking to the air, when he that ſpoke was a Barbarian to him that heard, and when he that heard could not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to him that ſpoke, Verſe 2, 9, 11, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. And if a Tongue acquired be as much unknown as a Tongue infuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Reaſons being common to both, the one is as much prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in thoſe circumſtances as the other.</p>
                     <p>Nay, according to their way of arguing, it will follow, That if Tongues miraculouſly infuſed, which were a <hi>ſign to them that believed not,</hi> might not be uſed in the caſes aboveſaid, then much leſs may ſuch as are acquired, by Education and other humane wayes.</p>
                     <p>But they ſay farther, <q>That the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Tongue which no one underſtands in the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Bellarm. ibid. Sect, veraigitur. Sect. at objicies. Sect. in poſte. riore. S.</hi> C. <hi>p.</hi> 176.</note> whole Church, but not of that which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome, at leaſt by him that officiates.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for this they offer no manner of proof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any. For (1.) the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch a Tongue as is not for the Edification of the Church; but if ſome only underſtand it, thoſe that do not underſtand, are no more edified by the underſtanding of the reſt, then if none underſtood it. (2.) There are two ſorts of perſons concerned, one that can ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and another that cannot, whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned.</hi> But the Unlearned are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98824:124"/> as well (as he ſaith) to be reſpected as the Learned; and the Unlearned being ordinarily more then the Learned; it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be ſuch a Tongue which all or the moſt did underſtand that he pleads for; and ſuch a Tongue, which none or the feweſt did underſtand, that he pleads againſt.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They ſay, <q>The Apoſtle condemns a Barbarous Tongue, but not that which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>And we are farther told, <q>That all Tongues are <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>But all this is ſpoken very precariouſly. For the Apoſtle excepts no Tongue, as a Tongue, from being barbarous. For that is barbarous with him that is not underſtood, whither it be <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Arabick, Greek</hi> or <hi>Scythian, Latin</hi> or <hi>Dalmatick:</hi> In this Senſe <hi>Ovid</hi> took it, ſpeaking of, himſelf in Exile, amongſt the <hi>Getae,</hi>

                        <hi>I am here a Barbarian, becauſe I am not underſtood by any.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this ſenſe it is here taken by ancient Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors. <note place="margin">

                     <p>So that upon the whole it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtle means by an Unknown Tongue, that which is not underſtood of the People.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What are the Aſſemblies in which the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellarm. c. 16. init. Rhemiſts. annot. at. p.</hi> 462.</note> Apoſtle condemns the uſe of an Unknown Tongue?</p>
                     <p>The Champions of this Cauſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do alledge, <q>That much of the Chapter</q> refers to Spiritual Conferences and collocutory Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes then uſed in leſſer Aſſemblies, which they endeavour to prove more eſpecially from the Directions given by the Apoſtle, Verſe 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we ſhould grant that part of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe refers to ſuch Conferences, yet what is this to that part of it that treats of Publick Worſhip? Or indeed what is it to the purpoſe at all, when there were moſtly the ſame Offices uſed in one as the other, and the ſame End preſcribed to the uſe of them in both? Thoſe that do thus diſtinguiſh, have not ventured to tell us where the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98824:125"/> treat of the one, and where of the other: And it is evident that he applies his Argument of Edification to the whole, and then proceeds from one Office to another, from Propheſying to Praying, and Singing, if not alſo to the Lords Supper. Now where the End is common to all, without diſtinction, the means conducing to that End are in all alike to be obſerved. And if in thoſe leſſer Aſſemblies (when they expounded, prayed or ſung) they were to uſe a tongue known to the Aſſembly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without ſo doing, the Ends of their ſo aſſembling would have been defeated, then certainly it was, if not more, yet at leaſt as neceſſary, that the ſame order be obſerved when the whole Church came together into one place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> What was the Service uſed in thoſe Aſſemblies, and what was forbidden to be celebrated in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue?</p>
                     <p>Some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will underſtand it only of preaching; and thoſe that do grant it <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellarm. ibid. Sect. Veraigitur. Sect. ad hant igitur. Rhemiſts annot. in</hi> 1. Cor. 14. 26. <hi>p.</hi> 460.</note> to reſpect Prayers, yet will have it underſtood of ſuch Prayers as were inſpired. But what though the Prayers were inſpired, when they were to be uttered in a Tongue known to the Church, and were not to be uſed if they were not for the Edification of the Church; as they were not if not underſtood? And is not the Reaſon as full againſt Prayers not inſpired, when they are not underſtood; The Queſtion is not about Prayers, inſpired or not inſpired; but known and unknown; according to which all the Offices of the Church are to be tryed, as to their lawfulneſs and expedience.</p>
                     <p>But let the Prayers be as they will, yet ſay they, <q>The Apoſtle treats of them occaſionally <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Sanders orat. p</hi> 64. 66.</note> only.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppoſing this ſo to be, yet that is not to the purpoſe, for the Queſtion is not whither the Apoſtle treats ſo expreſly of Prayer as of propheſying; as whither the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Unknown Tongue, and the Argument taken from the End of Divine Offices lie not as expreſly againſt praying as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying in that way? And whither the words, <hi>If I pray in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my underſtanding remaineth unfruitful,</hi> &amp;c. v. 14. 16. are not as plain as <hi>he that ſpeaketh (or propheſyeth) in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, ſpeaketh not unto Men,</hi> &amp;c. If the prohibition be the ſame, and the reaſon of the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the ſame in both; then it is not the being expreſly or occaſionally handled, that can make ſo vaſt a difference, as that the former ſhall be lawful, and the latter unlawful</p>

                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. How far is the Apoſtle's prohibition to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?</p>
                     <p>This will be determined partly from what hath been before ſaid, and partly from the current of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, who as he layes down that general, <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying;</hi> ſo upon that principle, he prohibits the uſe of an Unknown Tongue, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it, Verſe 14. <hi>If I pray in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but my underſtanding remaineth unfruitful.</hi> Where he doth not ſpeak of a better and worſe, and prefer that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood before that which is not (as they would have it) but he ſpeaks of a good and bad; and ſo doth abſolutely condemn an Unknown Tongue for the unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. For, ſaith he, <hi>My Spirit prayeth,</hi> not <note place="margin">

                     <p>So that from the whole we may with good Reaſon conclude; that the adminiſtration of Divine Service in an Unknown tongue is as unlawful as expreſs Scripture can make it: And that after all their attempts to decline, pervert and overthrow it, the fourteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> remains in full force againſt the Opinion and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and is a ſufficient Reaſon on their part, to keep the Scripture in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, as long as their ſervice is contrary to the Scripture celebrated conſtantly in it.</p>

                     </gap>tent and mortified, more heavenly minded, and every way of better Lives, then the way and profeſſion of other Chriſtians: For to work men up to this holy frame and diſpoſition was one of the main deſigns of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, which intends to govern mens Actions, and reform their Temper, as well as to inform their Underſtandings, and direct their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And in this particular it differs much from all the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of the learned Heathen: For whereas they deſign'd eſpecially to exalt the paſsions. and to raiſe up the Mind above it ſelf, by commending the high and pompous Vertues, thereby to ſtir men up to great deſigns, and to appear bold and braving in the affairs of this Life; the Goſpel is moſt frequent in commendation of the humble lowly and mortifying Vertues, which would reduce the Mind to it ſelf, and keep Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in due bounds, and teach them how to behave themſelves towards God, and to live in a due regard to another Life.</p>
                  <p>Now there is ſcarcely any thing which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth more often urge for her ſelf, or with greater confidence pretend to excel the Church of <hi>England</hi> in, then by endeavouring to perſwade, that the Frame of their Church is more fitted <hi>for the exciting of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and a good Life then ours is, And ſo they will boaſt of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Rules and Orders, the Auſterities of their Faſts and Penances, the ſtrict and mortifyed Lives, the conſtancy and inceſſancy of Devotions uſed among them; and would thence inferre, that that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though Devotion is properly and chiefly in the mind, a due ſenſe of God and Religion, yet it is not ſufficient if it ſtop there: For there are certain outward Acts which are either in themſelves natural and proper Expreſſions, or elſe are ſtrictly required of us by God, as Duties of Religion, and Evidences of the devout temper of our Minds; and theſe are called Acts of Devotion. And all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that can be given of any Church, on Account of Devotion, muſt be either, that there is a true Foundation laid for it in mens Minds, or conſtant Proviſion made for the due Exerciſe of it, all neceſſary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement given to it, and a ſutable, ſtrict and regular Practice of it obſervable among them.

                  <p>For it is obſerved that they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of <hi>diſpute,</hi> endeavour to work on our People, and too often prevail, by appealin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. They blame the Reformation in general, as well as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the want of Monaſteries and ſuch other Religious Houſes, which are ſo numerous in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries; where Holy Men and Women being ſhut up, and having bid adiew to the World, live as in Heaven in conſtant Exerciſe of praiſing of God Night and Day, and of praying to him for the Church and State, and particular Chriſtians, as well as themſelves; and who are not only ſo beneficial to the World, by the conſtancy of their Prayers, but alſo by their Example putting others in mind of Religion, and of <hi>doing likewiſe;</hi> and by the ſeverity of their lives, as to Diet, Garbe, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, live in a conſtant Practice of that ſelf-denyal which is commanded in Scripture, and was ſo practiſed by Holy Men almoſt from the begining of Chriſtianity; and are as it were conſtant Preachers of Holineſs and Mortification; who tho' they do indeed ſtay here in the World below, yet converſe not in it, but are in ſome Senſe out of it, and live above it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſometimes alſo boaſt of the extraordinary Charity, and Liberality to all good and Holy Uſes preſſed and practiſed among them, which is but ſparingly uſed, ſay they, among the Proteſtants; Eſpecially their exceſſive Expence and Coſt in building and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monaſteries, erecting Churches, Chappels and Croſſes, their ſo pompous adorning the places dedicated to the Worſhip of God, beſides their Charitable Aſsiſtance, and relief which they afford to the Bodies of the Living, and the Souls of the Dead; and no Man can deny but Charity is a certaint Evidence, as well as a great
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98824:133"/> branch and duty of true Religion and Devotion:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes they glory in the great number of Saints commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in their Church, and dying in the Communion of it, and urge them as a forcible Example to others, and a mighty incentive to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; they think alſo it redounds much to the Honour, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their Church to have had ſuch glorious Members of it, and twit us as they think ſeverely, when they ask us what Saints we have of our Church, and wonder eſpecially that we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo few Feſtivals and Holidayes; whereas the very many dayes ſet apart in their Church in memory of their ſeveral Saints, they think not only afford proper Occaſions, for all Acts of Religion; but are a ſign of their being leſs addicted to this World, when ſo great a part of their time is ſpent in the Service of God, and that Piety and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are a conſiderable part of their Buſineſs and Imployment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They urge alſo the multitude of Pictures and Images of ſeveral Famous Men and Women, who have in an eminent manner ſerved and pleaſed God, and been inſtrumental in converting the World, as very proper aſſiſtances of a Mans Devotion; inſtructing ſome, they being the Books of the Unlearned, and ſenſibly affecting and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring all to the Imitation of the Perſons whom they repreſent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sometimes they commend their Church for the Faſtings, and other Acts of ſeverity and Mortification, uſed not only by the <hi>Monks</hi> and Regulars, but by all ſorts of Men, according to the Rules of their Church, on ſet dayes of the Week or Seaſons of the Year; as well as ſuch Auſterities as are enjoyned by their Confeſſors, by way of Penance; their going bare-foot and bare headed in Proceſſions, their whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and laſhing themſelves their drawing great Chains and Weights after them, as great and proper Inſtances of Self-denial and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They place alſo a great Deal of Religion in Pilgrimages, which the more Devout ſort take, and ſpend their Eſtates, and ſometimes their Lives in, to <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Loretto,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mount-ferrdt,</hi> to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> at <hi>Canterbury</hi> St. <hi>Winefrid's</hi> Well, or ſome ſuch other places where ſome extraordinary Perſon hath lived, or ſome ſtrange Relique is left, or where they reckon God hath on ſome Occaſion or other wonderfully manifeſted himſelf; and they reckon that the very viſiting or kiſſing theſe, are either an Argument of truly Devout Minds, or that which will make them ſo. And their Manuals or Books which their Prieſts give into the peoples hands, do not fail by all the art imaginable, to endeavour to ſcrew up Mens Devotion, even to rapture and extaſie in Commendation of theſe Practiſes and Orders, even as if they would have us believe that there is no true Religion and Devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, and that where there are theſe things practiſed, it is a certain ſign that the mind is affected as it ought, &amp; Piety flouriſheth in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree.</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:98824:133"/>
                  <p>And beſides theſe Matters of Practice, their are alſo ſeveral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Opinions peculiar to themſelves, which they reckon do naturally tend to the advancement of true Devotion. As,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Their Doctrine concerning the Interceſſion of Saints for us, and the Advantage of Invocation or prayer to them, and that we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> want one of the greateſt Encouragements to Prayer and Devotion that can be, who neither own nor make uſe of theſe Helps, and therefore that we cannot have ſuch hope of Succeſs and Bleſſing as they have.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Their Doctrine concerning the Merit of Good Works and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation, is of the ſame Nature, in their eſteem: For the more Worth you ſuppoſe in any Action, the greater Incouragement is there to the performance of it, and therefore ſurely it muſt be a moſt irreſiſtible motive to Devotion, to perſwade men that the worth and value of it is ſuch, as that you may by it purchaſe Heaven not only to your ſelves, but for others alſo.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Their belief of Purgato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And eſpecially their Doctrine and Practice of Confeſſion, Penance and Abſolution, they look on as ſo neceſſary to Devotion, that it is a wonder with them that there ſhould be any ſhew of it, where theſe are received and practiſed: For a particular Conſeſſion of all Sins to a Prieſt being ſo ſtrictly required, they ſay is the readieſt way to bring men to a ſenſe of, and ſhame for their Sins; and Penance being alſo impoſed preſently on them, will ſurely make Men to be more afraid of ſining again when they ſee it muſt coſt them ſo dear, and that they may not deſpair or deſpond, by Reaſon of the Multitude or Weight of their former Sins, but may be encouraged to ſtrive more earneſtly againſt ſin for the future, the Prieſt gives them Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of what is paſſed, at the ſame time encouraging their hope, as well as exciting their fear, and endeavouring by the ſame method both to allure, to force and to ſhame Men into Amendment.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly they inſiſt much alſo on the Validity of their Ordinations, the Truth and Succeſſion, Unity and Authority, of their Church, and the Obedience that is payed to the Rules and Orders of it, as mighty Helps and Aſſiſtances, and Encouragements to Devotion; when they are ſo ſure of the Sacraments being duly adminiſtred, and all other Acts of Authority rightly performed when the Laws of the Church for the punishment of Offenders are duly executed, and when the Church hath Power to oblige all to an Uniform and Regular Practice.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are, I think indeed, the moſt that they do urge for themſelves in this point, and there is ſomething of appearance of Truth in all this. Moſt of theſe Inſtances are ſuch as may perhaps be very taking at firſt fight with ſome People, they having a ſhew of Regularity, Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Severity, or elſe of being proper helps and Aſſiſtances of Devotion: For men are wont to admire any thing that looks o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if we examine them, we ſhall find them to fall infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of ſuch ſpecious pretences; ſome of them to be unlawful, and thoſe that are good in themſelves, to be ſome way or other ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the uſe of them; alwayes they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For it hath been well obſerved by the judicious Sir <hi>Edwin Sandyes,</hi> that the Church of Rome hath ſo contrived its Rules and Orders, as rather to comply with, and fit every Temper and Inclination good or bad, then to work any real good effect on any. And therefore as it hath ſeveral things which openly agree with, and pleaſe the profane and debauch'd; ſo it muſt be granted, that it hath ſomewhat alſo to ſuit with and gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifle the melancholly Temper, where the devoutly diſpoſed may find ſomewhat an agreeable Retreat: And therefore one would be apt to ſuſpect that the moſt ſtrict and ſevere of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were kept up rather out of a politick end to pleaſe and quiet the People, then really to advance true piety to God and Devotion. But however it is plain, that taking the whole Frame of that Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it doth not deſign to promot ſerious and true Devotion; but only to make a Noiſe, and to appear ſo to do. For when I ſee the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98824:134"/> ſame Church, tho' ſometimes ſeeming to countenance the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeverity as neceſſary, yet at other times to give all Liberty, and let the Rein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear they are not in earneſt for Religion: For all ſuch irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Heats, are a ſign of a bad Principles, or a diſtemper'd Conſtitution. Juſt as if I ſhould ſee the ſame perſon ſometimes deſperately diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and debauch'd, and at othertimes intollerably ſtrict and ſevere, and this interchangeably and often; I ſhall much queſtion his ſtrictneſs, whither it be ſincere: If his ſenſe of Piety were real, it would be more laſting and uniform; and therefore without breach of charity I think I may look on him in his ſeverity, rather to act a part on a Stage, and to ſerve a preſent Turn and Occaſion, then to be really in his mind what ſuch ſtrictneſs would repreſent him. And therefore whatever true Devotion is in any of that Communion, ought to be aſcribed to ſomewhat elſe, then to the Conſtitution of that Church: For even thoſe things which they are uſed to boaſt moſt of, which I have mentioned already, we ſhall eaſily find to have little that is truly commendable, much that is greatly faulty in them; and if their beſt things are no better, what are the worſt? If the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their <hi>Glory is ſhameful,</hi> what will become of the reſt?</p>
                  <p>2, And therfore I'll now ſhew what we have juſtly to except againſt their fore-mentioned pretences to Devotion.</p>
                  <p>1. As for Monkery in general, which they boaſt ſo much of calling it, <hi>Status Perfectionis &amp; religioſus,</hi> as if beſides the State of Men in Holy Orders, that were a State of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and nothing elſe worth the Name of <hi>Religious.</hi> We confeſs, that ſcarcely as to any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Externals of Religion, doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> diſtinguiſh it ſelf from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſo much, as that there is not any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made, or ſo much as a ſuppoſition of ſuch Monaſtries, or religious Houſes, or publick places of Retirement for devout Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they are called, being again ever ſetled among us. For tho' we are not ſo raſh as utterly to abhor and throw away every thing that at any time had been abuſed to ſuperſtition, yet we are very well contented that Monaſtries ſhould never be rebuilt among us. For we do not look on the Life of Monks as any great help to Devotion, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of true Religion prevailing where they are found; much leſs that they are neceſſary in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>For it is evident that the firſt and pureſt Ages of the Church did not know any thing of them: Almoſt three Centuries paſſed without any mention of them in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian Perſecution, being taken notice of as the firſt of that Way. We read indeed of ſome that did lead a more then ordinary ſevere Courſe, and denied themſelves much of the (perhaps) lawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life, in reſpect to Religion and the other Life; but theſe

                        </gap>icks,</hi> or mortified Men, differed much from the preſent <hi>Monks</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We find not that they engaged themſelves in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vow, diſtinct from, or above that of their Baptiſm. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their general Courſe of Life was, they would take the Liberty to break their Rule ſometimes in order to extraordinary Charity, or when an occaſion offered it ſelf of doing more good; as is recorded particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning <hi>Spiridion</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Nor do we find that they always continued in the ſame State of Life; but took ſuch a ſevere courſe on themſelves at ſome particular times, and on ſome ſpecial occaſions, (as the <hi>Nazarites</hi> of old did) to humble, and bring their Bodies under, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth the married, but not to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue always ſo, leſt Satan ſhould tempt them; and they reckoned it in an higher degree praiſe worthy for every Act of Mortification to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, then that they ſhould once for all force themſelves to it: And therefore ſtill retained a Power to themſelves, and did vary from this Method ſometimes, and on occaſion would indulge themſelves a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, tho' ſtill a lawful Liberty. They took not on them the Vow of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> nor placed Perfection in Beggery, but reckoned every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God to be good; and even the outward good things of this Life to be <hi>the Gift and Grace of God,</hi> if they be well imployed, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. And remembred that Saying of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Acts 20. 35. It is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</hi> Nor did they vow what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now calls <hi>Chaſtity</hi> but reckoned themſelves as chaſte in Wedlock; and as for <hi>Obedience;</hi> the third part of the <hi>Monks</hi> Vow, they thought it ſufficient to obey the Commands of God, and knew not of any other Obedience due from them, but only to their Governours in Church and State, whoſe lawful Commands they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned themſelves obliged to, in order to the more regular Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Affairs, and the more peaceable Government of the World; much leſs had they any diſtinct Rules to be ſet up in Competition with the Laws of God, and urged as neceſſary to Salvation, making even the Commandments of God of none effect, as many of the <hi>Monks</hi> Rules apparently do, as might be eaſily made to appear. Such religious Men as theſe there were in the firſt Ages, who practiſed a ſtricter Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then others, that God's Name might be the more hallowed by them, the more it was profaned by the reſt of the World, and who were more then ordinary inſtant and conſtant in Prayers for a Bleſſing on the Church and State, of which they were Members; and by the Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Severity of their Lives, made ſome amends for the Negligence and Viciouſneſs of the Age in which they lived.</p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:98824:135"/>
                  <p>And many ſuch as theſe, we doubt not, are now among us, who yet utterly diſlike the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Monkery, And if by the Monaſtick Life all this were done, and nothing elſe deſigned, It were juſtly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; For let Men deny themſelves as much as they will, and uſe their Chriſtian Liberty to the Reſtraint of themſelves by a voluntary Self denial and Mortification, to keep their bodies under, and thereby get a better Temper of Mind. But all this will not ſuffice in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For it is not enough for a man to live ſo ſtrict and holy a Life, unleſs he enter into a Vow particularlie to this purpoſe. Nay, though a man do take on him all theſe Vow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or, who one would think were the propereſt perſons in the Caſe, yet ſtill it is not ſufficient; he cannot be ſaid to be in this <hi>religions State,</hi> unleſs he vow Obedience to another kind of Spiritual Juriſdiction. So that it is neither the living ſo ſtrictly, nor vowing to live ſtrictlie, as the moſt ſevere <hi>Monks;</hi> but it is their being of a particular Order, and living under ſuch and ſuch Rule, that is ſo meritorious; ſo that by Monkery indeed, Monkerie is encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome politick and Secular Deſigns anſwered; but the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety and Devotion is not principally deſigned or intended. But to diſcourſe more diſtinctly of it;</p>
                  <p>In a Monaſtick Life theſe three things are eſpeciallie remarkable,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſecluded, and perhaps Eremetical way of living which they lead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Conſtancy and Regularity of Devotions practiſed there.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>But I muſt needs ſay, that there is little of true Devotion, that I can diſcover in any of theſe.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their being ſhut up from the World, or living in Deſarts, is no very proper Inſtance of their Devotion, or agreeable to the Deſign of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>For a man ſhould converſe in the World, elſe he cannot ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, what is amiſs, or wanting in it, nor how even to apply and place the Emphaſis of his Prayers.</p>
                  <p>A man that lives in a Wilderneſs, or ſhut up alwayes in a Monaſtery, it is poſſible that he may keep himſelf free from the Difilements of the World; but yet it muſt be looked on as much more noble and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to converſe in the World, and yet to avoid the Pollution of it.</p>
                  <p>And tho' by ſuch a ſecluded Life he may eſcape one kind of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſtill he will be at leaſt as liable to the two others; that ariſe from the <hi>Devil,</hi> or his own <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> as ever. And if he avoid ſome Sins, yet ſtill he will be more ſubject to others, Sowerneſs.

And yet ſuch as theſe are generally legible and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the very Looks, converſation and carriage-of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Hermits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Retiredneſs ſometimes is an excellent help to the Mind, by giving it time to recollect it ſelf, and to reflect on its former Miſcarriages, and the better, to prepare it ſelf for its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture encounters in the World. But a man may exceed in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees of this, as well as of other conveniences and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enjoyments; and ſo it may become a ſnare and an evil to him; For the mind will naturally be as much tir'd with Solitude as with bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Beſides, that the Devil is alwayes buſie when men are idle and Diverſion and Recreation is as neceſſary to moſt Tempers, as Health, and Cheerfulneſs are; and fits a man even for the Duties of Religion. For the keeping the mind in a conſtant Bent, tho' of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will in a ſhort time weaken its Spring and dull its Edge; and the Acts of Devotion in ſuch a mind, will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>its to be feared, be rather a formal piece of Drudgery then a reaſonable ſervice. And though we ſhould grant, that by being confined to a Monaſtry, a man might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſcape the Defilements of any kind of ſin; yet it muſt be granted that he cannot be in ſo much capacity of doing good in the World as if he converſed freely with it: <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We are ſure that publick ſervice ought to be preferred before private, the Glory of God, and the good of men being more advanced by it; and therefore, though that man that lives in a wilderneſs, and ſerves God there when he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by perſecution, may hope for a Bleſſing, tho' he be alone, and neither worſhippeth God in publick, nor gives a good Example to the World; yet he that runs into a Wilderneſs to be wondred at and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and neglects the ordinary and moſt uſeful way of ſerving God, there is too much reaſon to fear <hi>he hath his Reward.</hi> At leaſt how far ſoever it may pleaſe God to pardon his blind Zeal, and want of Diſcretion, yet certainly this Example of his ought not to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all, as a Rule for them to walk by. The firſt Monks we grant, were very good and pious Men, and were compelled to forſake their Houſes, and live in ſolitude; but it is very unreaſonable to make their manner of Life a Pattern to be followed in the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ages of the Church.

                  <p>And as the Solitude of a Monaſtick Life is no proper Aſſiſtance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ules of Living, which are given us by himſelf, and his Holy Apoſtles, never enjoyn or ſuppoſe any ſuch thing. We are alwayes ſuppoſed to live in Company and Society; and accordingly the precepts of our Saviour and the Apoſtles are adapted to the common Caſes of Men, and the Concerns of ſuch as converſe freely in the World. And therefore I muſt needs ſay, that it hath been very wiſely ordered, that there ſhould be new and diſtinct Rules made for thoſe that delight in this ſolitary and Monaſtick way of Life: For they are ſuch a kind of men as the Goſpel of Chriſt hath no proper Rules for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And I am afraid that there is as little true Devotion in their ſo frequent and conſtant Prayers enjoyned and practiſed in their Monaſtries, though this be confeſſedly what is moſt commendable in their way of Life, and is the only way by which they themſelves can pretend to do any Good in the World. (If I except thoſe, which are but very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ew, that work with their hands.)</p>
                  <p>Praiſe and prayer is therefore acceptable with GOD, as it is in the voluntary Expreſſion of our Souls, a free will-Offering and Sacrifice which we offer to GOD, in conſideration of his infinite Excellencies and Perfections in himſelf, his former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved Goodneſs to us, and our Liableneſs to him. Now the conſtant prayer uſed in their Monaſtries, in more particulars then one, come ſhort of that true Devotion due from Men to their Maker: For firſt they are as much as can be forced on a rational Beeing, and on that account muſt needs loſe much of their worth and acceptableneſs. The <hi>Monks</hi> are oblidged by the Rules of their ſeveral Orders to ſay ſuch and ſuch prayers, and juſt at ſuch and ſuch times, whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion or Intention of Mind they have; and they are ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed if they fail of them. Exactly at Midnight, at two or three a Clock in the Morning, ſo very often, and at ſo very unſeaſonable times, that many have confeſſed this ſtrictneſs of their Devotions, to be of all the greateſt burden of their Lives And yet this they muſt do in Imitation of ſome holy Man of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98824:137"/> Old, who is recorded to have pray'd at theſe Hours; whereas theſe Mens Devotions is not warm enough to keep them awake when they are at Prayer. And therefore theſe Prayers not being the free Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own mind, methinks the praiſe of them is not ſo much due to the <hi>Monks</hi> themſelves, as to the head and founder of their Order, who oblidged them to ſuch Rules.</p>
                  <p>And their Devotion is little more praiſe-worthy then that of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Avignon,</hi> and ſeveral other Places, who are once in a Week forced to go to Church and hear a Sermon, (as theſe <hi>Monks</hi> are) at leaſt to ſit there whilſt a Sermon is preached. and return home as good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as they went thither.</p>
                  <p>But then they are not only thus ſtrictlie obliged to ſuch Hours of Prayer, for that were ſomewhat tolerable, they might poſſibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on their Prayers, notwithſtanding. But they are at the ſame time taught, that they need only ſay the Words with their Mouths; it is not abſolutelie neceſſarie that their mind ſhould go along with them, and this together with the other muſt needs ſpoil all true Devotion. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie and unſeaſonableneſs of their Prayers, will make it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for them to attend as they ought, and their Doctrine concerning the No-neceſſity of attention at Prayer, will certainly make them to yield to theſe difficulties, and ſo there may be abundance of <hi>Words</hi> ſaid, but no <hi>Devotion</hi> perform'd.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, they have a way of being eaſed of this trouble of the Prayers, for according to their Caſuiſts, it is allowable for a man to get or hire another to ſay his Prayers for him. At leaſt he may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with by his Superiour, and this Diſpenſation is good, whither there be a juſt Reaſon or Occaſion for it or no, according to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maxim of theirs, <hi>Non ad Valo rem, ſed ad Juſtitiam requiritur Cauſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if after all this, Men ſtill will be more then they need ſtrict in their Prayers, according to the Rules of their Orders, they almoſt conſtantlie offend in the End, and Deſign of their Devotions. For they do them not ſo much to benefit the World, or work themſelves up to a better temper of Mind; but to perform a task impoſed on them, and which they have vowed to perform, or eſpeciallie to merit by their works. For they do not ſo much as pretend that this ſtrictneſs in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is abſolutelie neceſſary for their Salvation, (for elſe why do they not enjoin it to all, ſeing all have the ſame need of Salvation?) and therefore the ſole end of all this ſtrictneſs and conſtancy in Prayers, is only to get Heaven for others. Which Opinion, beſides that it will mightilie diſcourage Men of an ordinarie Charitie, from being very intent on what they do, when they are ſenſible they Labour only for another; It countenanceth alſo a falſe and dangerous Doctrine concerning the Merit of good Works, and encourageth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98824:137"/> all vicious practices in other Men, who will hope to be ſaved, tho' not by their own Prayers, yet by the Prayers of theſe holy <hi>Monks</hi> ſaid for them.</p>
                  <p>So that on many accounts, their is little of true Devoton to be found in that conſtant courſe of Prayers, ſaid ſo regularlie by the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Hermits;</hi> Not to mention ſeveral other particulars, concerning the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of their Prayers, the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or prayed to, the <hi>Perſons prayed for,</hi> and the like, which <hi>I</hi> may have Occaſion to mention afterwards, which being put together, do abundantlie ſhew the improprietie, and the worthleſneſs of ſuch Devotions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as to the <hi>Auſterities</hi> of the Lives of their <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> the Puniſhments which they inflict on themſelves, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs for the ſake of Religion, by <hi>courſe</hi> and <hi>uneaſie Garments, ſcanty Food and Fare, long and tedious Watchings; frequent and cruel Whippings, and Laſhings,</hi> and other ſuch Courſe and Harſh Treatments, which they uſe towards their own bodies. I confeſs I pitie them, but can diſcern little or no true Chriſtian Devotion in them.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>all Severity</hi> to our bodies is not Devotion, or any part of that Self-denial which the Goſpel requires; nor is this of theirs, though they pretend it to be <hi>for the ſake of Religion;</hi> but their inſiſting ſo ſtrictly on it, and valuing themſelves ſo much on it, is of very <hi>bad conſequence</hi> to Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All Puniſhment</hi> which men inflict on themſelves is not Religion, nor commendable, nor is the patient bearing of it alwayes a Sign of a true Chriſtian Temper. Chriſt hath no where told us, that he that can faſt longeſt, or endure moſt Laſhes is the beſt Man; but he that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf and his Life beſt. We have ſtrange Inſtances of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of Pain in many of the worſt Principles and moſt profligate Conſciences: The Devil hath his Martyrs as well as God; and if the voluntarily inflicting Puniſhment on themſelves be a Sign of Devotion, the Prieſts of <hi>Baal, 1 Kings</hi> 18. muſt have been a very devout Generation of Men. Therefore it is not any religious commendation of a Man, that he can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onſtantly whip, or laſh himſelf, or bear it from another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flinching: Such a man might have made a good <hi>Gladiator,</hi> but ſeems not ſo well qualified for a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is all Puniſhment which Men inflict on themſelves, and ſay they do it for the <hi>ſake of God and Religion,</hi> alwayes a Sign of true Devotion: For in other Caſes, it is not Men's ſaying that they deſign well, which will make their Actions acceptable with God; but it is their doing what he hath commanded, and for the ends which he deſigned and intended, with which he is well pleaſed. And it too of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en happens, that men do Actions having a ſhew of Sanctitie, and of great Self denial, which yet are received by God only, with a <hi>who hath required this at your hands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:98824:138"/>
                  <p>Self-denial indeed is commanded in Scripture, and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo to many and excellent Purpoſes, to ſubdue a man's Paſſions and Affections, and to bring him to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of himſelf; to put a man in mind of leaving the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things of this World, ſenſibly to affect him with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that are in Miſery, and alwayes want th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, and to inure him to bear patiently the adverſe things, or whatever it ſhall pleaſe God to lay upon him. It is neceſſary that a man ſhould have a mind alwayes ready and prepared to loſe all for Chriſt: And therefore he ought often to deny himſelf ſomewhat for the Sake of Chriſt, that he may give full proof to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his mind is affected as it ought to be: And by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Acts of this Nature he preſerves a Power over himſelf, and is much the more fitted for all the Accidents of Life, and for the Exerciſe of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>But let a man have a care that he keep within due bounds: He may exceed and tranſgreſs both in the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and in the <hi>End and Deſign</hi> of ſuch Mortification, He exceeds in the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of it, when he inflicts ſuch Severity on himſelf as ſhal ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him unfit for the Service of God, and uſeleſs in his Place. God delights not in the puniſhment of his Creatures, but deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es their Good here as far as it is conſiſtent with their greater Good hereafter. And though he requires Self-denial of us, it is only in ſuch a meaſure as is for our Good, in order to the bettering of our Temper, and to cut off the Occaſions of Sin in us. And therefore it is a great fault in any man on this pretence to render his Life ſo uneaſie to himſelf, as that he ſhal not be able to ſerve God contentedly, cheerfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtraction, As a Man may be to blame alſo for his Charity, when without a juſt Occaſion he throws, or gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all; For if this Courſe were allowed or followed, the worſt People, and they that know leaſt how to uſe an Eſtate well, would be the richeſt and Owners of all, and the only perſons in Authority and Power,</p>
                  <p>And he tranſgreſſeth alſo in the <hi>end and Deſign</hi> of ſuch Severity, when he pretends to merit by it, and hopes to buy Heaven (which is the Gift of God) with a few Laſhes, or a litte Money.</p>
                  <p>And I have too much reaſon to under value and diſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Monks</hi> on both theſe Accounts. They <hi>often</hi> tie themſelves up to ſuch Degrees of Strictneſs as are above the Meaſures of a man, and conſequently not to the purpoſe of Religion and Devotion. And they <hi>alwayes</hi> deſign to purchaſe Heaven for themſelves or other, by the Merits of ſuch Sufferings: At the ſame time under-valuing the Sufferings of Chriſt, and over-valuing their own; and yet mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98824:138"/> them of leſs worth in in God's eſteem then elſe they would be' by their own ſetting ſo high a price upon them.</p>
                  <p>And beſides all this, their inſiſting ſo ſtrictly on theſe pieces of Auſterity, and placing ſuch Religion and Perfection in them, is of very ill conſequence to other purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>It makes men to acquieſce in the <hi>means</hi> as the <hi>end,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with having performed their Faſts, their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prayers and Laſhes, without ever aiming at any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Change of Temper and Practiſes; then which nothing can be more abſurd in it ſelf, or more contrary to the the Deſign of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>It makes men alſo to eſteem this or that kind of Meat and Drinke, Condition or Courſe of Life, to be unlawful or ſinful, which really is not; which doth much harm, even to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: For it diſparageth God's Creation and brings an <hi>evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> upon the Land. It neceſſarily makes Men querulous and cenſorious; and is the very thing which our Saviour took ſuch pains to correct, and did ſo often rebuke the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of his Time for.</p>
                  <p>And this extraordinary pretence to Severity, brings the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch Men into Eſteem, whatever their Principles, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices otherwiſe are, and ſo injures Religion. For ſo <hi>eccleſtaſtical</hi> Hiſtory tells us, That thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> that have moſt hurt the Church, were ſuch kind of pretended mortified Men, as <hi>Montanus, Pelagius.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that what do theſe more then others? Do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore however praiſe-worthy the <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Life might have been formerly, and whatever good might have been done, by ſome of that Order, Yet thisis'no Plea for the <hi>Monks</hi> at this time. For the <hi>Ancients</hi> were very Inſtrumental in converting many to Chriſtianity; but <hi>theſe</hi> only live on the ſpoil of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians already made ſo. And conſidering the preſent poſture of Affairs in the World, this <hi>Monkiſh</hi> way of living is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and the abuſes that are made of it in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are plainly intollerable. Where Men are taught to place Religion in a certain Way and Trade of Life, rather then in a truly Chriſtian converſation. It ſtrikes at the very Foundation of our Religion, for Men to be made to believe, that the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dying in the Habit of this or that ſevere Order of <hi>Monks,</hi> will have an Influence on the Soul, and give it a better Title to Heaven. And yet it is too notorious that theſe things are confidently taught and believed among them.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, let Men deny themſelves as much as they will, for the ſake of God and of Religion, to humble themſelves
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98824:139"/> for their Sins, and to keep their bodies and Paſſions under.

                  <p>Beſides it is very <hi>unreaſonable</hi> for Perſons to be ſhut up in Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo as they are, when they are young, and before they can have fully conſidered what Temptations they may have, or how they ſhall be able to bear and withſtand them; and yet if they have but once, though of a ſudden, through their own Melancholly, or the Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, taken the vow on themſelves, there is ordinarily no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking or drawing back for ever,</p>
                  <p>It is very <hi>cruel</hi> alſo for Perſons to be put there, without any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their ſeveral Tempers, and Circumſtances. For inſtead of benefiting the publick, which they pretend, it robbeth the World of many an one that would have been uſeful to it in an Active Life and Station. And ſome by their Tempers do not need ſuch Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the melanchollie and dejected.

So that in truth <hi>I</hi> look on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtries, as they are now ordered, to be rather a kind of Priſons, and places of Puniſhment, then convenient places of Retirement in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the freer and more undiſturbed Exerciſe of Religion and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98824:139"/> Devotion. And if I am not miſtaken, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf whatever ſhe pretends, really thinks ſo of them: For the worſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that ſhe inflicts on a Prieſt for one of the worſt of Offences, <hi>viz.</hi> for his violating the Seal of Confeſſion, is, that he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be ſhut up in a Monaſtry: and I dare ſay, that he and I agree in thinking that to be a ſevere Puniſhment, rather then an Help to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And if the Multitude of Monaſtries in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no certain Sign of Devotion flouriſhing among them, they have little reaſon to boaſt of their <hi>Works of Charity:</hi> For it is moſt plain that the biggeſt part of their Charity is turned this way, to the building and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing Monaſtries, and to the Encouragement of the Monaſtick way of living.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this, though I am very loath to find fault with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Charity, yet I have too much reaſon on many accounts to think very meanly of all that which is practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For whatever hath been given to that Church under the Name of <hi>charity,</hi> and is now enjoyed by it, hath for the moſt part been ill gotten and is as ill imployed.</p>
                  <p>And here I will not treat of the temporal Power of the Pope himſelf; and of the ſeveral Principalities which he ſtands poſſeſſed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> for they cannot be ranged under the Head of <hi>charity,</hi> according to my acceptation of the Word; though it might be eaſily made to appear, that they have generally been gotten by unjuſt and unlawful, or at beſt by harſh and cruel Means, and ſuch as one would not expect from the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> But I concern my ſelf with ſmaller and more private Benefactions and Gifts, though theſe are ſo conſiderable, that generally a third part, often half the Lands of a Countrey are the Propriety of the Church. Now all this is gotten chiefly from men that are dying, who can keep their Riches no longer, and therefore who do not ſo much give this from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as from their Heirs; And is eſpecially, as it were, to buy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and a man muſt have a moſt deſpicable eſteem of Heaven, who will not give all the good things of this Life, when he can no longer uſe or enjoy them, for the Purchaſe of it: And what is given from ſo bad a Principle, is commonly applyed to as bad a purpoſe. It is a common Obſervation, that in all the Popiſh Countries the Poor are the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the World; and their Secular Prieſts too are generally in a ſad condition, notwithſtanning the infinite Riches of that Church: And ſo the Regulars only have any conſiderable advantage by them; &amp; they alſo, as it were, club together to ſet up one great Man as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, or Head of their Order, in mighty Pomp and State; and heap Riches and preferments on him till he can hardly bear them. So that one can ſcarcely ſuppoſe ſo great Riches as that Church is in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98824:140"/> common endowed with, to be gotten into fewer Hands, or do leſs Good then it doth amongſt them. Let them not therfore boaſt of their <hi>Charity,</hi> whilſt amidſt ſo great Plenty, they ſuffer the poor to want ſo extreamly; and yet to make a Shew, build a fine Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in two or three of their chief Towns: For perhaps no where in the World do the rich exalt themſelves, and tyrannize over the Poor, no where is there a greater inequality of Conditions; no where is there ſo much given to the Church and Charity. and no where is the Eſtate of the Church engroſſed into ſo few Hands, to maintain Grandeur, rather then to be a Relief to Poverty. For the Cardinals not above Seventy in number are maintained out of the Church-Revenues, and yet are by their Creation equal to Kings, and ſuperiour to Princes. Now if this be Charity to have a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Revenue for the Maintienance of the Church and Poor, and yet to imploy this to the Luxury of a few, and to let the reſt periſh I will acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the moſt charitable Church in the World. And if it be ſaid that a great deal indeed hath been given to good and truly charitable uſes, but is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps miſimployed: I anſwer, it is poſſible it may be ſo, yet ſtill I have ſome reaſon to queſtion it; For their Doctrines of Merit, and of buying Souls out of Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are enough to ſpoil their works of Charity, and make them to be rather eſteem'd a Bargain of Sale then a free Gift. And yet their Donations run commonly in this Form, <hi>I give this to ſuch a Monaſtry for the good of my Soul, or of the Souls of other perſons deceaſed, or for the Honour of ſuch a Saint;</hi> But ſeldom for the good of the Poor, the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Support of true Piety and Religion; or for the Glory and Honour of God: And yet in my Opinion ſuch as theſe are the ends for which a Gift ought to be eſteemed <hi>charitable,</hi> or will be accepted by God as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>But now on the other ſide, though the Church of <hi>England</hi> own not either <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or any other of their Pick-pocket Doctrines, yet <hi>charity</hi> urged by us from truly Chriſtian Principles, hath had more force, and done more good then all their Tricks and Devices put together: For ſo Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> hath in part ſhewn; and it might be more fully demonſtrated, that in theſe laſt 120, or 130 Years, ſince the ſettling of the Reformation among us, there hath been more and greater <hi>Churches, Schools</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> built and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, better Proviſion made for the Poor; more and better care taken, not only for the Maintenance, but eſpecially for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ignorant and meanner ſort of People; In ſhort, all parts of <hi>Charity</hi> more fully exerciſed, then can be ſhewn in any the like number of Years ſince Chriſtianity came into this Countrey. Indeed the general Strain of our Peoples <hi>Charity</hi> runs to the doing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98824:140"/> of more good, and is more properly expreſſed then theirs is. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> build Monaſtries, in which Proviſion is made for a few people to live in Idleneſs and Luxury under pretence of Devotion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement: Ours relieve the Sick and Needy (tho' not Regulars) and think it better Charity to preſerve a poor Family from ſtarving (of which ſo many thouſands die in Popiſh Countreys) then to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an idle <hi>Monk</hi> or <hi>Nun,</hi> or to make a Preſent to the Lady at <hi>Loret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> or offer Candles and Tapers to the Image, or Saint of the Town in which we live. We, by ſo beſtowing our <hi>Charity,</hi> both <hi>honour God,</hi> and <hi>do good to Men.</hi> They do neither, but do Homage to a Saint that neither knows them, nor receives any Good by the Honour which they give them.</p>
                  <p>It is in deed confeſſed, that our Churches are not ſo adorned as they ought ſometimes: But that is no Fault of our Church, but of the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Times, and of thoſe Diſſentions which they raiſe among us; but generally they are decently grave, and as well fitted to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a devout mind without Diſtraction as can be. We love to have our churches neat and handſome, to ſhew we do not grudge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be required to make them in ſome meaſure a ſit place for Divine Worſhip; but we ſee not any neceſſity of having them ſo ſplendidly rich and fine; we think it would rather divert mens minds from the Buſineſs of the place, then aſſiſt them in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, in no part of <hi>Charity</hi> can they pretend to exceed us, conſidering our circumſtances, unleſs it be in that of Prayer for the Dead, when they hire ſo many Maſſes to be ſaid for them; but we think not this ſo much <hi>charity</hi> to the perſon deceaſed, as to the Prieſt; for he doubtleſs receives moſt benefit from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And whatever they pretend, the great number of Saints canonized and commemorated among them, is neither a Sign of the good State and condition of their church, nor is their keeping ſo many Holy dayes in remembrance of them any inſtance of true Devotion.</p>
                  <p>As for many of the Saints which they commemorate we own as well as they, and can pretend as good a right in them as they can, becauſe we own, and will ſubmit to whatever can be urged from them, ſuch are the Bleſſed Virgin, the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts; and after them alſo the Biſhops, Martyrs and Confeſſors in the Primitive church: but we confeſs that we have not the ſame eſteem of many whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate as Saints, and utterly di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>allow of their canonizing or Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: For many of them (I believe) never had any being, but in the Fancy of theſe Saint-makers, who yet are commemorated, and prayed to as well as any others. Such as St. <hi>Longinus,</hi> under which name they have made a Man of the Spear which pierced our
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98824:141"/> Saviours Bleſſed Body. St. <hi>Almachius,</hi> on <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. which only comes from the Corruption of <hi>Alman ack;</hi> Saint <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> who was only St. <hi>Alban's</hi> Cloak; St. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula,</hi> and her 11000 Virgins, of whom no Foot-ſteps can be found in true Hiſtory. Many of them, I fear, it had been better that they had never been, as being notoriouſly vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſcandalous in their Lives. And others, though more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yet if we believe what is written in their Lives, were ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly ridiculous, that a wiſe and religious man would be aſham'd of ſuch company. To hear men in an Extaſie of Devotion to talk Non-ſence, or to preach to Birds and Beaſts, to run naked, to wander voluntarily in Deſarts. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is more likely with ſober men, to bring their perſons and Actions into contempt and ſcorn, then to affect them with any quick Senſe of Religion; at beſt it will excite men only to that extatical and enthuſiaſtical kind of Devotion, which was in vogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, whoſe Preiſts were beſides themſelves, when they ſpake in the Name of their Gods: and their moſt celebrated Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion were ſuch kind of irrational Actions; but there is nothing of this at all countenanced under Chriſtianity: For the Goſpel would make us wiſe as well as devout; and it is not required that we put off the Man, but the Old Man and its Vices when we become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>And though we are ſenſible of many among us that have been very examplary for Vertue and Piety, and have no reaſon to doubt of their Salvation: but have as full Aſſurance of it, at leaſt, as they of their Saints; yet we are very ſhy of canonizing or ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, becauſe we know not Mens Hearts, nor dare we to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to diſpoſe ſo abſolutely of Heaven as the Pope doth. We thank God for thoſe that have lived and died well among us, and exhort our People to imitate all the Good which ſhewed it ſelf in them; but we know not to what purpoſe Canonization is. If it be only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their Vertues to Example, the Canonization of them will ſignifie no more then the bare Hiſtory of their good Lives faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded would do; but if it be in order to praying to them, we utterly condemn it. And it is too plain, that this is the end of their being cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized: For from that time ſolemn Prayer and Invocation is allowed and offered up to them. And this I believe hath been an occaſion of falling from the Truth of Chriſtian Doctrine as well as practice: For they taking ſuch a man to be a Saint, think themſelves oblidged to follow and vindicate whatever he either did or ſaid, as holy and true, not conſidering that the beſt of meer Men have been guilty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and Imperfections; and then much more may we ſuſpect the Judgment and Underſtanding, the Vertue and Piety of many of thoſe that fill up the bigger part of the Romiſh Kalendar,</p>
                  <p>And for the ſame reaſon we think there is not much Religion or
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98824:141"/> Devotion expreſſed in the keeping up the Memory of ſuch Saints, by ſo many holydayes obſerved among them.</p>
                  <p>If they commend their holydayes for the opportunities afforded in in them of ſerving God in publik, we have ſuch Conveniencies in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-places every day.</p>
                  <p>If they comend them as dayes ſet apart to Reſt and Idleneſs, we are not altogether of their mind; for we think we have as many as our Poor can well ſpare; and are ſure that they have more holy dayes then their Poor can afford to obſerve So that their Holy dayes are no advantage to any. The Rich need them not; becauſe if they have Abilities, they may be idle and luxurious every day: But they are a great evil and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the poor, when they are forced to loſe ſo many dayes from their Work, by which they ſhould maintain themſelves and their Families. And though the Popes, by reaſon of this Cry of the poor, have been prevailed with to cut off many of thoſe days of Idleneſs, yet ſtill in moſt places the Number of them is intolerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for Images, I ſhould have thought it more proper to range them among the <hi>Hinderances</hi> of Devotion, did I not ſee the Men of <hi>Rome</hi> to plead earneſtlie for them, as <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtances,</hi> and to blame us for not uſing them, and paying no reſpect to them.</p>
                  <p>I conſeſs my ſelf not a cute enough to diſcern how they can any wayes advance Devotion: For their paying ſuch Honour and Reſpect to them <hi>as they do own</hi> and acknowledge, muſt needs be a great Diſtraction, it diverting the Mind, and making Men ſpend their religious Reverence on that which is expoſed to their View: but their paying ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to them as <hi>they do pay, but are aſhamed to own,</hi> is flatly deſtructive to all true Devotion.</p>
                  <p>They indeed plead the Ignorance of the People for the neceſſity of Images, and call them the Books of the Unlearned: but they muſt <hi>firſt</hi> ſuppoſe their People inſufferably ignorant to need ſuch Helps as theſe are. And to give the Prieſts their due, if any Ignorance would ſuffice to juſtifie ſuch a Practice: they take care to keep their People in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſufficient: And <hi>then</hi> if they are ſo ignorant that they cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God without an Image, the Church cannot be ſecure, but theſe ſo ſillie People may worſhip the Image for God or Chriſt; or at leaſt as having ſome extraordinary Vertue in it, and ſo make an Idol of it, eſpecially when they ſee the Eyes and Hands of the Image to move, and ſee Miracles wrought by the Touch of it, as is frequently pretended and believed to be done: So that either there is no need of Images, or great danger in the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I am not of Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Mind, who thinks that they may be properly or ſafely uſed to excite Devotion; at leaſt I muſt confeſs my ſelf of a different temper from him. Methinks I repreſent God in greater Majeſty to my ſelf, when I conſider him in his Works of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98824:142"/> Creation and Providence, then to ſee him pictured; as in the Clouds, though with Thunder in his hand. And my Saviour appears more lovely to my mind &amp; thoughts when I conſider him as coming into the World and dying for us, then when I ſee him pictured and carved on a Crucifix. For it is more uſeful to ſee him with the Eye of Faith then of Senſe, and it is not the Proportion of his Body repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my eyes, but the Dignity of his Nature, the love that he bore me, and the Paſſions of his Soul for me, that I admire moſt, and which no Pencil can draw.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, a Picture or Image tells me nothing but what I knew before; and it is by what I knew before that I can make ſenſe or any devout uſe of this Picture; for elſe I might take it for another profane and idle Story, And I would fain know whither the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderately the 26, and <hi>27th.</hi> Chapters of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> will not affect any pious Heart much more then the ſeeing and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating a Picture. Certainly if this will affect the Senſe and bodily Paſſions, the other will more work on our Reaſon, and that will be to better purpoſe. Nay, the ſeeing of any Picture often will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally make it <hi>familiar,</hi> and not at all affecting to us.</p>
                  <p>5. And if the ſeverity of the <hi>Monks</hi> to their Bodies is not any great Sign of <hi>Devotion,</hi> much leſs can the Auſterities uſed by the common People turn to any great Commendation of the Church. It is true, they are forced to keep Faſts, but it would make a Man laugh to read how their Caſuiſts have defined concerning the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> the Meaſure the End of Faſting. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> hath reſolved it, <q>That no Drink breaks a Faſt, be it Wine or Chocolat; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not wholeſome to drink without eating, you may eat two Ounces of Bread: For that is but a quarter of a Meal; and if a man ſhould chance to break his Vow of Faſting thus, he is not bound to faſt another day for it, unleſs on a new Obligation. And if all this be too hard, you may be diſpenſed with for your whole Life; and that whither there be any juſt cauſe for it or no. Nay, Servants, tho they eat never ſo gluttonouſly of the Scraps, they break no Faſt. Indeed there need be no Rules ſet down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</q> the Poor Peoples obſerving Faſting Dayes: They are kept low enough without them: And as for the Rich, their Faſting is Mock-faſting, to faſt to Luxury, with Wine, and Fiſh, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats: Is not this great Self denial? If any therefore are ſtill truly mortified, when they can thus help it, I muſt rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their own Piety, and devout Temper, then the Rules and Orders of their Church, which give much Liberty, that a man muſt have a very croſs-grain'd Appetite, or be in the higheſt degree ſenſual, not to be willing to comply with it. We find then no Fault with Faſting being enjoyned, and at ſet ſeaſons: For we our
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98824:142"/> ſelves commend and practiſe it; but let it not be to play tricks, but for true and real Mortification, and for the proper end of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to humble the Body to the Soul, and to bring the Mind to a better Temper; and to theſe ends is Faſting commanded by our Church; but not as if we looked on this or that kind of Meat to be unholy, or deſign'd to purchaſe Heaven by our Abſtinence, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>6. And as for their Pilgrimages, and Worſhip of Reliques, they muſt needs have leſs pretence to Religion: For their Faſts, and other Auſterities ſomewhat reſemble true Chriſtian Duties; but theſe have no ſhew that way. If Pilgrimage <hi>be enjoyned for Penance,</hi> then there is no thanks due to the Perſon performing it.</p>
                  <p>If it be voluntary, there is no true Devotion in it: For the Worth of it muſt conſiſt in ſome of theſe Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> either, Firſt, That GOD is more preſent, or Secondly, more propitious in one publick place of Worſhip then another, both which are contrary either to the Nature of God, or his Declaration in Scripture, when he ſays, <hi>In every place a pure Offering ſhall be offered to him,</hi> Mal. 1. 11. And <hi>Where ever two or three are gathered together in Chriſts Name, he is in the midſt of them:</hi> Mat. 18. 20. And the teaching otherwiſe is in ſome meaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> which allowed God, as to ſome caſes, to be ſerved accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably only in one place, or Thirdly, that the Saint is more preſent or propitious here then any where elſe: But we are ſpeaking of Devotion to God, not to the Saint; or Fourthly, That it is their <hi>puniſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> that is ſo acceptable; but that hath been ſufficiently diſcarded already: Or, Fifthly, That going ſo far, and taking ſuch pains <hi>is a ſign of their Love:</hi> But a man may ſhew his Love to God, and to his Saints too by more proper Inſtances, and do more good by it, which GOD, to be ſure, will better accept, and the Saint, if he be a Saint will like as well. And therefore the making ſuch account of Pilgrimages, ſeems rather to favour the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> then the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion: For the going on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> is one of the five indiſpenſable points of the Mahumetan Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Veneration of Reliques,</hi> all the World knows, what a cheat is put on Men, in vending any old rotten Bone, or peice of Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Relique of this or that Saint: So that according to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Computation, I ſuppoſe ſcarcely one in a hundred is true: And ſome have pleaded they need not be true. Now what ever Devotion is performed <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>on occaſion</hi> of theſe Reliques, can be commendable only in regard of the Mind and devout Temper of the Perſon; which I think might as acceptably ſhew it ſelf in any other proper time and place: And there is required a long <hi>Series</hi> of Conſequences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſight of St. <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Axe, or any ſuch other of their Reliques, can be pretended to raiſe a man's Devotion. But it being the chief Trade at
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98824:143"/> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> to ſell feigned pieces of Antiquity, and other ſuch worthleſs Trinkets at a high rate, I the leſs wonder that they have ſuch an Eſteem for Reliques; for it is for their profit to keep up the value of them, they being the principal commodities of the place.</p>
                  <p>7. And the belief which they have of the <hi>Saints hearing them,</hi> and their practice of <hi>praying to them,</hi> is no proper Encouragement or inſtance of true Devotion: For all Devotion is properly towards God; and therefore the making of Addreſſes to any other cannot poſſibly have any direct Tendency to exalt our Devotion to him, but is really a great hinderance, For it takes mens Mindes off from GOD, and ſets them on his Creature: And the ſame time that is ſpent in Prayer to them, ſurely is better ſpent in praying to God, who is more preſent with us, hears us better, and loves us more. And Men's going to Saints when God is preſent, naturally tends to provoke God's <hi>Jealouſie:</hi> For he declares himſelf <hi>jealous</hi> as to his Worſhip particularly, to ſet them up in competition with God, and to create in Men an Opinion, that they are more eaſily entreated, and readier to do us a Kindneſs then he is. And therefore though Men may fear God more, yet they will rather love the Saint; and Love is the trueſt Motive to ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as will be beſt accepted with God And yet in this plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts all that Court which they make to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe ſhould <hi>pacifie the Anger</hi> of GOD the Father, or of the Son towards Men; they are repreſented ſevere, and almoſt cruel, to render her more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable to the people in her interceeding for them: So they frequently in their printed and allowed Books of Devotion, call her <hi>Fountain of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Pity,</hi> and other Names of the like Importance. Now all the aſſurance they have of her being tender and compaſſionate, is only becauſe ſhe is a Woman: but they are aſſured of God's Mercy, both from his Nature and his Word: They have no Aſſurance that ſhe, or any other Saint hears them; nor can they ſhew how the Saint can be rationally ſuppoſed to know every thing that we do or ſay; but they are well aſſured that God hears them: For he is ſtilled <hi>the God that heareth Prayer;</hi> which Prerogative of his, by every Prayer to a Saint, they may at leaſt ſuſpect that they intrench on. They are not aſſured that the Saint can help them; but they may be fully ſatisfied of his Help, who is Almighty. They have no Encouragement from Scripture for praying to Saints: For though the Angels rejoyce at the <hi>repentance of a ſinner,</hi> it doth not follow that therefore every concern of Men is known, or Prayer heard by them; much leſs that we may pray to them for the Gift of Repentance, or any other Grace, And prayer being ſo conſiderable a part of Divine Worſhip, we need not doubt but the Angels and Saints would refuſe it: For ſo St. <hi>John</hi> was rebuked for offering to Worſhip the Angel, though ſuppoſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and viſibly with him, <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 19. 10.</p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98824:143"/>
                  <p>So that if they prayed to Saints and Angels only to <hi>mediate and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> for them to GOD, it is more then they have any Warrant or Allowance for. Chriſt being alwayes repreſented as the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man; and the ſetting up his ſervants in his Office, is as far as is poſſible a depoſing of him. Nor is it in this caſe, as it is in Courts on Earth (which is their common Excuſe) where a Favourite is made uſe of to repreſent our cauſe and requeſt to the King: For this is done becauſe our Kings do not know our Perſons, nor underſtand our Caſe, nor can they be preſent in all places, and hear all cauſes themſelves: ſo that it is often neceſſary that Princes ſhould imploy and truſt other then their own Eyes and Ears. Many things they think below them to inquire particularly into; and ſometimes they will do that at the requeſt of a Favourite, which they would not do for the ſake of a Perſon that is not particularly known to them. But there is no Room nor Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this in the Court of Heaven: For God is not onely intimately known, but is immediately preſent to all his Creatures; as he hath declar'd himſelf no Reſpecter of Perſons, but to love all, and therefore there is no need of any Interceſſor for us, except the Lord Jeſus; he affects not empty pomp and ſtate; but his Providence extends to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Concern of the meaneſt of all his creatures; and though he may give ſome undeſerved Favours, as longer Lives, and farther Opportunities of Amendment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the ſake of others Prayers, yet no man is ſo far his Favourite, as to be able to perſwade him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe his own Laws, and to ſave a wicked Perſon that continues in his Wickedneſs. On all which Accounts there is no Occaſion of praying to the Saints ſo much as to interceed for us, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. But to pray to them to <hi>bleſs us,</hi> and <hi>give us</hi> this or that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſpiritual Good, as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſe, and to ſuppoſe them to have Power to help us in this or that particular Difficulty and Diſtemper is plainly intollerable: For this is in a great meaſure to revive Heatheniſm, by which Men Worſhipped this or that GOD for this or that particular Caſe. They muſt grant the Saint to have, though not an Original, yet a moſt certain and deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, according to which he will not fail to aſſiſt them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; and in all ſuch Prayer, methinks, they even terminate their Worſhip on the Saint: For if I pray to a Saint to help me in this or that Difficulty, with a full aſſurance that this Saint hath ſufficient power to help me, though I ſhould grant that this Saint received this Power from GOD, yet my prayers terminate on the Saint. Indeed the Saint is oblidged to God for that power; but <hi>I</hi> ſeem to own my ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblidged to the Saint, for his applying this his general power to my particular caſe: Juſt as I am oblidged to a man for giving me an Eſtate, though he is beholden to the Government and Laws, that either he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Eſtate himſelf, or was impowered to give it to another.</p>

                  <p>Beſides that they often pray to Saints for ſuch things, which, if they be only Creatures, they can have no power to give, or to be even ſo much as the Inſtruments of conveying to us; and yet it is notorious, they pray ſometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now can any man ſay, that ſuch Prayers as theſe are fit to be offered up to a Creature, or that they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Devotion of a Chriſtian, when they are ſo offered? I am ſure that we charge the Heathen with giving Divine Worſhip to Men, though we can hardly find any Expreſſions or prayers to their Gods, which are ſo high, and argue their terminating their Worſhip on them ſo fully as theſe, and other ſuch, which are commonly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to Saints, and eſpecially to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. And whatever they pretend, the conſtant Trade which they make of <hi>Confeſſion and Penance,</hi> and their Doctrine concerning them, is ſo far from encouraging Devotion, that it is enough to deſtroy all true Devotion out of the World, if the providence of God did not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly interpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For though they be very conſtant in their Confeſſions of all their Sins to a Prieſt, yet the frequency of it in themſelves and others; makes them not ſo much as a ſhamed of themſelves; and though they may be more afraid of angring their Prieſts, yet they have no reaſon to abhor themſelves, or their Sins in the ſight of GOD any more for it.</p>
                  <p>And when they have thus confeſſed, their Confeſſor may enjoyn what Penance he pleaſeth, or elſe may leave it to the Penitents own choice as <hi>Eſcobar</hi> from <hi>Suarez</hi> affirms; and men are not uſed to be very cruel to their own Bodies, or lay a very ſevere penance on themſelves when a lighter will ſerve; or elſe the Confeſſor may ſay thus, <q>I impoſe on thee for penance whatever good thing thou haſt done, or ſhalt do this Day, or this Week, or whatever Evil thou haſt,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98824:144"/> or ſhalt ſuffer. And Cardinal <hi>Tolet</hi> is of the ſame mind too. Now will</q> not this make a man mightilie afraid of ſining any more, when his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Converſation, and the unavoidable Caſualtie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of life ſhall be turned into a ſufficient Penance, Satisfaction, and Puniſhment for his Sin? And if the Confeſſor enjoyn no Penance at all, indeed he is to blame, ſayes <hi>Eſcobar;</hi> but ſtill it is a Sacrament for all that, becauſe a ſatisfactory penance is not an <hi>eſſential</hi> part of the Sacrament; but an <hi>Integral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if after all this the Confeſſor will impoſe a Penance, the Penitent may perform what he will of it: For ſayes <hi>Tolet,</hi> if he do not perform his Penance, his Abſolution ſtands good, only when he comes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion next, he muſt confeſs that he did not perform his penance and ſo his Non-performance of penance will paſs away in the Crowd of his other Sins, and there is an end of it. And if this pleaſe them not, there is an eaſier way ſtill, if need be: For you may get another man to do your penance for you. Is not this a fine eaſie way to Heaven, when the faſting and ſtarving of the Poor may be made to ſerve for a ſatisfaction for the Sins and Debauchery of the Rich? Indeed <hi>Eſcobar</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> ſayes, There ought to be a juſt Cauſe for one's performing penance for another: But here the other diſtinction will help them, <hi>non ad valorem, ſed ad juſtitiam requiritur cauſa,</hi> the penance is valid, though there be no juſt Cauſe. And whither there be a Cauſe or no, it is not doubted, ſayes <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> but one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the penance for another, if the Confeſſor will give leave: And it is to be hoped there are ſome good natured Conſeſſors to be found: But good Cardinal <note n="*" place="margin">Tolet Inſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And laſtly, he goes on, &amp; ſhews, that though the penitent be enjoyned to perform his penance in, on perſon, yet he may
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98824:145"/> transfer this to another, <hi>without his Confeſſor's leave;</hi> and yet he ſhall obtain the <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> part of penance, though not the <hi>meritorions,</hi> that is, he <hi>ſhall be excuſed from ſuffering evil;</hi> but ſhall not <hi>merit</hi> much at God's Hands by ſuch penance. And indeed I think he is very unreaſonable if he expect more: And beſides all this, the deſign of all penance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to ſatisfie the Debt of Temporal puniſhment due to their Sins, there are ſeveral eaſie wayes provided by their Church for the diſcharge of it, beſides the ſever penance, as <hi>e. g.</hi> ſeveral ſhort Prayers, to the ſaying of which ſome ſcores of thouſands of years pardon are annexed, <hi>toties quoties;</hi> there are large Indulgences granted at <hi>Jubilees,</hi> and at ſeveral other good Times; and may at any time be had for a good ſum of Money; And if a man take no care of himſelf all his Life, yet if he can purchaſe Prayers to be ſaid for him after his death, it will ſerve as well. And though the penance be never ſo eaſie, and be performed as triflingly, yet the Abſolution, by which they ſuppoſe the Debt of eternal puniſhment is diſcharged, muſt be as compleat and full as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: For ſo the aforenamed Cardinal, with a great deal of concern, takes Care that the Abſolution be not pronounced <hi>conditionally,</hi> as, <hi>e. g.</hi> on condition that you <hi>amend your Life,</hi> or <hi>performe your penance,</hi> &amp;c. but it muſt be pronounced abſolutely, without any <hi>if</hi> or <hi>and,</hi> thus, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now would not any one think, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by this Method of Confeſſions and Penances ſo taught and practiſed among them, rather deſigns to find out the Temper and Inclinations of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; to dive into the councils of great Men, or to anſwer ſome other ſuch politick End, then to advance piety towards God, or Amendment of Life in the Penitent? I am ſure they can have no hearty reſpect for <hi>Devotion,</hi> when they are taught to look on their prayers to God, as a ſevere Penance, and yet which they may be releaſed from by winning a Game at Cards, as is too commonly known.</p>
                  <p>9. And their Doctrine concerning the <hi>Merit of good Works</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,</hi> as it is falſe, ſo we cannot look on it as any Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to devotion; for God will not be ſerved with a lye.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, if what is required of Men in their <hi>Confeſſion and Penances</hi> be enough to ſave their Souls, they may very eaſily do more then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: For they cannot do leſs, if they do any thing, though indeed one would would wonder, that any that conſider the Nature of the Goſpel, or the Words of our Saviour, ſhould ever pretend to ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing their Doctrine to be true in theſe points, they cannot be thought to advance Devotion, but rather hinder it: For ſeing it is ſomewhat natural for a Man to love his own Laſe, every one will be apt to argue with himſelf, that ſo many have <hi>merited</hi> already, that there is no need of what he can do. Nay, it is Folly for him to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98824:145"/> attempt it. For what need he endeavour to add to a Stock of Merit, which is already infinite, as ſome have thought?</p>
                  <p>And indeed it had need be infinite, elſe it is to be feared, it is almoſt, if not quite ſpent, eſpecially conſidering the vaſt Expence of theſe Merits in frequent <hi>Jubilees,</hi> and other Indulgences, the Multitude of Sinners, and the little extraordinary Vertue and Piety found among them at this day, to add to their Store; So that methinks it may juſtly be queſtion'd whither they are not bankrupt before now, their Disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt ſo much exceeding their Receipts; and the Credit of their Bank ſeems to depend wholly on their <hi>Old flock</hi> of Merit which the Ancients laid up for them; and yet they grant that this was rather caſual, then out of Deſign or good Nature; For the Saints deſign'd only to make ſure doing enough for themſelves, and it ſeems that leſs ſerved their turns then they thought of, and the reſt was laid by for the uſe of ſuch rich Sinners as the Church would ſell it to. So that all the Stock of Merit, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſo great occaſion for and of which there is made ſo prodigious an Expence, is at the beſt but a Chance and ſpare-heap, which they cannot tell how they came by (for every Biſhop hath the ſame Title to ſuch <hi>Treaſure trove</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath,) nay they have reaſon to fear there was never any ſuch Treaſure: (For I doubt not but the Saints in heaven will thankfully own, that they have received more from GOD then they deſerved, or could challenge:) to be ſure, they knew not how much there was ever laid up, nor whither the Stock be ſpent; and yet they ſpend as freely now, as if they had been only laying up till this time, and that the Treaſure were now firſt opened.</p>
                  <p>Many other ſuch Abſurdities and unanſwerable Difficulties there are in their Doctrine of <hi>Merits</hi> to the uſe of others. And is it not a diſmal thing, that the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould teach men to truſt in, and as to Salvation, depend aſſuredly on theſe, of which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have no manner of aſſurance nor Ground to hope. Is not this to play with Men's ſouls and eternal Salvation? And eſpecially can this be urged as an encouragement of Devotion, when, if it were as true as it is falſe, it tends directly to make Men vicious, and to neglect Devotion: For ſo a man will think if there be ſuch a Stock in the Church, why ſhould not he have a Share of it as well as another? And if one can merit for another, why ſhould not he depend on others, as well as they on his <hi>Merits?</hi> And ſeeing Merits may be bought as the <hi>Roman</hi> Caſuiſts have adjudged, he may think it very reaſonable that others Merits ſhould be given him in exchange for his Money. So the Reſult of all is this, according to this Doctrine, and the ſuppoſed <hi>Church-flock,</hi> only one thing is needful, and that is Money; and this will <hi>fully make</hi> up all lack of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi>

                  <p>10. And the belief of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and of the validity of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead,</hi> is no proper Encouragement of <hi>true Devotion:</hi> For <hi>true Devotion</hi> is ſuch as we perform to God, agreeably to his Will, when we know what we do, and for what ends; and have a promiſe or hope of Succeſs; but when a man prayes to God to deliver a Soul out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he muſt ſuppoſe as true ſeveral things which are either falſe, or at leaſt very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; ſo that he can never pray in <hi>Faith,</hi> or without great perplexitie and diſtraction of mind; for he knows not whither there by any ſuch place or ſtate as <hi>Purgatory:</hi> For Scripture ſayes nothing of it, nor the Fathers of the three or four firſt Centuries. He knows not whither the Soul that he prayes for be in <hi>Purgatory</hi> (if there ſhould be ſuch a place) for it may be in Heaven or in Hell, for ought he can tell. And if the Soul be in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he knows not whither it be Uſefull or Lawful to pray for it; for God hath given us neither Command, nor Encouragement, nor Liberty ſo to do, Nay, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars which they themſelves cannot agree on concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Purgatory, viz.</hi> What Sins are puniſhed there? How the Soul without its Body can be tormented there with a material Fire? Who are Gods Inſtruments in puniſhing the Souls there? For the Devils are not; and how the Pope by his Indulgences can applie the Satisfactions of Chriſt and of the Saints ſo as to deliver any Soul out of <hi>Purgatory?</hi> And if there be ſuch a place the Pope himſelf by his Example doth enough to diſhearten all Men from endeavouring to deliver the Souls of their Friends from thence: For it is not doubted but he can deliver all out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> he having the Command of the Treaſure of the Church. And it muſt needs be a wonderful Diſcouragement to a Devout Mind, that among ſo many hundred Popes, their ſhould not be one found ſo Charitable as to releaſe ſo many thouſands of poor Soul that lye under intolerable pains, and ſo muſt lye till the laſt day, or till the deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> it is plain that they have more diviſions among themſelves, then they can charge us with. For they have not only ſuch as openly diſſent and ſeperate from them, but great and violent diſſentions among their own Members, and ſuch as live in the Communion of their Church, one againſt another, and each party pleads the Doctrine of the Church, and Deciſions of its Councils. And yet the Pope himſelf, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Infallibility and Authority, either cannot or darr not determine which is in the Right, or which Opininion is True.</p>
                  <p>So that what ever <hi>Power and Authority</hi> their Church hath, it hath no effect to ſuch ends and purpoſes, to which Church-Power is deſigned to ſerve, the encouragment of Holines and Vertue, and the diſcountenancing of vice, the Preſervation of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98824:147"/> Doctrine in Purity, and of the Members at peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is true they are more able to ſee the Laws of their Church Duly executed; but it is to their diſparagement to have ſo much Power, and yet to do ſo little good w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th it. As for us, we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerve more then we have, then that it ſhould be ſaid that we have more power then we deſerve. And whatever Power our Church wants, and whatever loſs Religion ſuffers by this means, we juſtly Charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the guilt of it, who have made all Princes jealous, and affraid of all Church-Power; by their invading their temporal Rights under pretence of a Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, though ſomewhat may be ſaid for the worſt thing, and a very bade Cauſe may have a great deal pleaded in its Vindication, as we have ſeen in all the foregoing Helps and Inſtances of Devotion; which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> boaſts of; yet if we conſider them, they all in ſome reſpect or other come ſhort of what they pretend to; ſeveral of them being very improper, many plainly Nonſenſical and Ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they proceed from bad principles, are done in an undue Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Meaſure, or to ſerve ſome bad end or deſign, or ſome ſuch other way offend; even the moſt ſevere practices, which moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble true Self-denial, are countenanced or enjoyned rather to make a ſhew, or to gratifie ſome tempers, then to advance Devotion; for exceſſes and over-actings are often Infirmities, and the effects of Weakneſs; ſteddineſs being the moſt certain ſign of Strength, as the ſhaking palſy is a Diſeaſe and ſign of weakneſs, as well as the <hi>Dead one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. I now come to conſider ſuch things in the Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as tend directly to promote Debauchery of Manners, and Careleſneſs in Devotion.</p>
                  <p>I'll inſiſt only on theſe few, among very many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The unlimited Power which they aſcribe to the Church, or to the Pope as Head or Monarch of it: For the people are taught that he can make null Duties that were made neceſſary by God, and make neceſſary what was not ſo before. The conſequence of which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is plainly this, that a Man may ſafely diſobey and neglect the ſerving of God, if he pay but his due reſpects to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And yet their Caſuiſts have defined that the Pope can diſpenſe with Sins, or give leave to do things forbidden by the law of God, as well as pardon them when committed, as in the Diſpenſations with <hi>unlawful Marriages.</hi> And on the other ſide he can excuſe them from doing what they are by their Duty to God bound to do, as in his Diſpenſations with <hi>Vows</hi> though made never ſo ſolemnly to God himſelf. That is, he can Bind where God hath left us looſe, and he can looſe where God has bound us. Nay, a Superiour can give a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> even when he doubteth whither it be lawful or no; <hi>becauſe in a doubtful caſe</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:98824:147"/> 
                     <hi>the milder ſide is to be taken.</hi> And if the Reaſon ceaſeth for which the Diſpenſation was given, yet the Diſpenſation doth not ceaſe: Nay, a Diſpenſation may be granted where there is no Reaſon or Cauſe for it; and yet the Diſpenſation is valide notwithſtanding. And not the People only, but every Biſhop and Prieſt hath his Share of this Power, only there are ſome <hi>reſerved</hi> and more profitable <hi>Caſes,</hi> which his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> only can diſpenſe in. And though I cannot tell what they <hi>think,</hi> yet I am ſure their Caſuiſts are very ſhy of <hi>ſaying,</hi> that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is any Caſe in which there may not be a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> granted for the doing of it; or a Pardon for it when it is done.</p>
                  <p>And all Indulgences are directly deſigned to hinder Devotion, for they are given to free Men from Neceſsity of <hi>Mortification, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Alms and Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. Which elſe would have been enjoyned as Penance; and yet we know that theſe are the chiefeſt parts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And as their general Doctrine concerning the validity of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Indulgences is very deſtructive of all true Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: So,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their conſtant Practice of giving <hi>Abſolution before Penance,</hi> is in a more eſpecial manner influential to that purpoſe. For the People are taught to believe, that by the Prieſts ſaying, <hi>I abſolve thee;</hi> &amp;c. the ſin is actually pardoned by God: And though indeed their Guides of Confeſſors adviſe that Abſolution ſhould not be given till Penance be impoſed and accepted, yet when the Confeſſor thinks that the Penitent will acept of the Penance, he may abſolve him firſt: That is, the Perſon may be abſolved before he accept the Penance, or even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to perform it; but it is their conſtant Method to abſolve him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Penance be actually perform'd.</p>
                  <p>Now if their Abſolution be of force, the Perſon is free from his ſin, and ſure enough of Heaven, whither he perform any penance or no: Which Practice gives all imaginable Encouragement and Licenſe to Sin; the fear of penance being the only reſtraint from Sin which they pretend to; for if the ſin be fully pardoned before Penance be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or performed: <hi>I</hi> ſee not why a man ſhould trouble himſelf much for the performance of his Penance: he ſees plainly that it is only an Appendix that is uſed to be annex'd to Abſolution, but is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary in it ſelf nor for Abſolution; the Sin is pardon'd already, and at the worſt there is only ſome temporal puniſhment to be ſatisfied for, which he may get rid of ſeveral other wayes.</p>
                  <p>Nay indeed the true and ancient Notion of penance is utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by its being impoſed and performed after Abſolution. For pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according to their primitive uſe of it, was a ſevere courſe of Life preſcribed to a perſon that had grieviouſly offended, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method for him, at the ſame time to teſtifie his own ſorrow for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98824:148"/> his Sin, and abhorrence of it, and to create in him an Averſation to the like for the time to come; and alſo to ſatisfie the Church of all this, that ſo he might be admitted to abſolution and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: And therefore their Penances were alwayes publick, and indeed is it by publick Penance only that all theſe ſo good ends can poſſibly be anſwered: but now in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is pardoned without any thing of this, he is not put to any grief for his Sin before he be abſolved. It is left wholly to his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Generoſity whither he will perform <hi>any Penance</hi> for his Sin. Nay indeed ſo loth are they to appear ſevere againſt ſin, or cruel to the ſinner; that when in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſome would have revived this Diſcipline, by enacting <hi>publick Penance,</hi> they were violently oppoſed and over-ruled; tho' St. <hi>Gregory</hi> a Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had held it to be <hi>of Divine Right:</hi> and their Caſuiſts ſince teach that a Confeſſor cannot, or ought not to enjoyn a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick penance:</hi> So that by this means a Man is not ſo much as to be put to the bluſh for his Sins; for no ſuch Penance muſt be impoſed by which the Sin may be known, and he is ſure that the Confeſſor to ſave a Kingdom darr not reveal or diſcover it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their Doctrine concerning the <hi>Nature of ſeveral Sins,</hi> is ſuch as muſt needs rather encourage Men to continue in Sin, then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from it; and will ſpoil all true Devotion to God, and that due regard that we ought to have to his Commandments.</p>
                  <p>They tell us there is a vaſt number of Sins in their own Nature <hi>Venial,</hi> which are ſo very inconſiderable that an <note place="margin">Eſcobar Tract. 2. Exam. 1. cap. 4.</note> infinite number of them altogether will not deprive a man of the Grace and Favour of God, or make up one Mortal ſin, and for the Pardon of which there is no need or occaſion for the Mercy of God: And yet they have no certain Rules to diſcover whither a ſin be <hi>Mortal</hi> or <hi>Venial,</hi> ſo that men are in wonderful danger of being cheated in a matter of ſo great Moment as their Eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>They tell us alſo, that <hi>Habitual Sin,</hi> is only a Stain left by former voluntary Sins, and a Deprivation of <note place="margin">Eſcobar Tract. 2. Exam. 1. cap. 2.</note> habitual Goodneſs; but hath nothing elſe that is evil in it. From which Doctrine it neceſſarily follows that a man is guilty only of thoſe Sins which created this <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> and that there is not an habitual Repentance, or Courſe of Life required to get pardon for habitual Sins; but a few or perhaps one ſingle Act of Contrition will ſerve. So that the more a Man ſinneth the better he may, and it is a piece of true Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to get an Habit of all Sin betimes; for a Man is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for thoſe ſins which preceeded the Habit; all the Sins which follow it will paſs under the name of <hi>Inadvertencies,</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98824:148"/> as ſuch can be eſteemed only as a kind of <hi>Venial</hi> ſins.</p>
                  <p>And they not only allow the Church Power to command what doth not belong to her in many Caſes; but give ſuch Authority to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as to make the Diſobedience to them the greateſt of all Sins, and make way for the breaking of the Laws of God, that they may keep thoſe of the Church. So <hi>Marriage</hi> hath been adjudged a greater Sin in a Prieſt then <hi>Fornication,</hi> becauſe the Prieſts are oblidg'd to <hi>Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy</hi> by the Laws of the Church, and their own Vow; as if they were not by the Laws of God, and their Vow of Baptiſm more oblidged to obſtain from <hi>Fornication;</hi> and accordingly for <hi>Marriage,</hi> a Prieſt is excommunicated or depoſed; but for <hi>Fornication</hi> he is only oblidged to conſeſs it ſecretly among his other ſins; and the Guilt and Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of it is done away by Abſolution. Indeed they bring almoſt all ſins under the Head of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> not only by pretending to give Pardon and Diſpenſations for moſt ſins that can be committed; but alſo when they compare ſins, they are alwayes moſt earneſt againſt ſuch as tranſgreſs the Command of the Church. <hi>So. v. g.</hi> When <hi>Eſcobar</hi> asks the Queſtion, <hi>What if</hi> I <hi>communicate unworthily at</hi> Eaſter? He anſwers, <hi>That by ſo doing, I fulfil the command of the Church, which is what I am immediately bound to:</hi> And paſſeth over the Duty of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination and Preparation ſo ſtrictly enjoyned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as not worthy to be conſidered: And ſo in inumerable other caſes, by which means indeed they create a great Veneration for the church, or for that which they call the church, but thereby make the commands of God of none effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their very Doctrine concerning their Prayers and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their Practice conſequent on it, is ſuch as is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Nature of true Devotion: For, according to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the outward Act will ſuffice in many caſes, though nothing of the Mind go along with it; particularly as to Prayers <hi>Eſcobar</hi> from <hi>Coninth</hi> and <hi>Durandus</hi> affirms, that neither an actual, nor virtual Attention is required when a man <hi>prayeth;</hi> and they give an excellent Reaſon for what they ſay, <hi>viz. Becauſe the Church hath no Power in hidden caſes, but only in the caſe of Auricular confeſſion:</hi> As if in Prayer only the power of the church, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its commands were to be regarded: And he confirmeth his Aſſertion with this other moſt cogent compariſon, That an outward Act of Devotion, or Prayer only with the Mouth, is a true Act of Prayer, tho' without the Intention, as an outward Act of Adoration of an Idol, though without the Intention, is a true Act of Idolatry. So that for a man to mind what he doth when he is at Prayers, or to be earneſt in his Deſires of that which he prayeth for, though it may poſſibly be a commendation, and accompliſhment, yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary either to the pleaſing of God, or ſatisfying of his Duty
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98824:149"/> according to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, it is a praiſe for a man to <hi>draw nigh with the mouth, and honour him with the Lips, though the Heart be far from God,</hi> notwithſtanding that our Saviour, after the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> blamed the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſo doing. Indeed ſuch a kind of ſuperficial Chriſtians will this Doctrine make, that a <hi>Phariſee</hi> would have been an excellent Man, if he had lived in theſe days.</p>
                  <p>And purſuant to this doctrine of no-neceſſity of Attention at prayers, they take care that the people ſhall not be able to attend to what is done; and therefore provide that the <hi>publick prayers</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf ſhall be only in a <hi>Language unknown</hi> to the people, and are ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately fond of this Device of keeping the people ignorant of what is prayed for, that their Caſuiſts have defined, that a Man may ſay his <hi>Office</hi> privately in other Languages beſides the <hi>Latin,</hi> as in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> but not in the Vulgar Language; at the ſame time keeping the people in Ignorance, and diſcouraging them in their devotions, and exerciſing their Authority over them in the moſt dangerous manner that can be.</p>
                  <p>6. Their aſcribing ſpiritual Effects to ſeveral things which are purely of their own Invention, is much to the diſcouragement of true devotion towards God. And yet they have very many things of this Nature: As <hi>Holy Water,</hi> by the being ſprinkled with which, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve rhe Devil ſhall have leſs power over them: <hi>Agnus Dei's, Swords</hi> and <hi>Medals</hi> which they wear to preſerve them from dangers; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſecrated according to the Rules of their Church, have through the devotion of the perſons, and the power of the Church, a wonderful good effect, though indeed God never promiſed any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>To this Head I may refer alſo, their <hi>Roſary,</hi> which is nothing elſe but an odd combination of <hi>Pater noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave Mary's.</hi> Several <hi>ſhort prayers</hi> to the ſaying of which thouſands of years of pardon of Sins are annex'd: Their carrying the Image of St. <hi>Genovefa</hi> in proceſſion at <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Images in other places to obtain Rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And innumerable other ſuch like practices, on which Men are taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and to expect great good by, though they have neither any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force or efficacy that way; nor any aſſurance from God that ſuch effects ſhall follow. Nay even the <hi>Sacraments</hi> themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are only ſuch a kind of <hi>charms;</hi> for they are ſuppoſed to work effectually on the perſon, without any devotion or Vertuous diſpoſition being required of him in order to it.</p>
                  <p>Now whatever effect they promiſe above what the natural efficacy of the thing is apt and able to produce, they muſt have expreſs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God, or elſe they ſadly delude and cheat thoſe poor ſouls that depend upon them. And at the beſt they are ſuppoſed only a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98824:149"/> ſhorter cut to Heaven, an eaſier way of pleaſing God and getting his Bleſſing, and are invented only to eaſe a Man of the fatigue and trouble of the common and ordinary road of ſerving <hi>him</hi> by a conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Devotions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Their Manuals and books of Devotion which they give their People to read, inſtead of the Scripture which they forbid to be uſed, though they may deſign them as <hi>Helps,</hi> yet I muſt range them among the <hi>Hindrances</hi> of <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the beſt of them are ſo full of Tautologies and vain Repetitions, that they muſt needs come uuder the cenſure of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. though they uſe his own holy Name. For ſo in the <hi>Jeſus Pſalter,</hi> at the end of the <hi>Manuals of Prayers and Litanies printed at</hi> Paris <hi>in Engliſh,</hi> An. 1682. In a Litany of fifteen Petitions, the Name <hi>Jeſu</hi> is repeated over above 130 times. And in the ſame book, in the <hi>Litany of the bleſſed Virgin,</hi> they pray to her by 40 ſeveral Names, being only ſo many diſtinct praiſes of her. And the like is obſervable in all their books of Devotion which I ever ſaw. Now their ſaying the ſame thing ſo often over, is not contrived to help and Aſſiſt Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or prevent Diſtraction, or as a Repetition of what is more then ordinarly important, or for any other good and prudent Reaſon, but out of pure vanity and Oſtentation, or as it were even to flatter our bleſſed Saviour, or the Saint which they pray to.</p>
                  <p>But moſt of the books and Legends which they put into the hands of their People to excite their Devotion, and by which the People take an eſtimate of the Chriſtian Religion, are ſuch wretched plain Forgeries and ſo pitifullie contrived Fables, as can never be believed by Men of ſenſe, and if they could be believed, are proper indeed to make Men Mad and Enthuſiaſtical, but not to advance true Devotion; and he that reads only ſuch books is qualified indeed to tell Stories and to believe Lies, but no ſerious truth will ſtick to him or be valued by him. So that ſuch books as theſe are ſo far from doing good, that they do much harm to Religion, for they Imprint a wrong No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion on Mens Minds; would make a Man believe that God is like a child pleaſed with Trifles, that Religion and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Salvation is only a Charm and Trick, which the Prieſts have gotten the receit of; but that there is nothing in Chriſtianity fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to make a man wiſe and manly in his Worſhip of God, or in the management of himſelf and practice of Devotion. Nay the ſtories which are told in the Lives of their Saints, and believed by the common people, are enough even to deprave the natural Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mankind concerning God and Religion, ſo that perhaps it were much better to leave Men to the natural effluxes of their own minds, then to pretend to aſſiſt them with ſuch Helps as theſe. That a little <hi>Water</hi> or a <hi>conſecrated Bell</hi> ſhould ſcare the devil, or St
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98824:150"/> 
                     <hi>Francis's</hi> rope charm and bind him, would make a man have little fear of ſuch an Enemy, or a prodigious Veneration for ſuch a Saint; but how it ſhould render a Man more piouſly affected toward GOD, more relying on his Providence, or more Religiouſly Carefull over himſelf, I ſee not: And theſe Stories though ſo apparently falſe, yet being affirmed with ſuch Confidence, ſtrike at the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Religion; For it is apt to make Men believe that Chriſtianity it ſelf was at firſt propagated among a ſad, dull, ſtupid, and credulous Generation of Men; (when as really it firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Age as ſharp-ſighted, as any Age before or ſince, which is much for its Vindication.) It would tempt a Man to diſpiſe a Religion in which ſuch Men are <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſuch Practices com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and will ſet Chriſtianity but on the ſame level with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Mahumetaniſm;</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> have juſt as much to ſay for their <hi>Cabbala,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> for their incredible <hi>Fables;</hi> for they are reported on the ſame Credit, are juſt ſo credible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and juſt as edifying of the People that attend to them: The Miracles which they relate being often Juſt ſo uſeful, as that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be wrought in the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> when a Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Temple, it was obſerved that his body did not caſt any ſhadow; by which thing however ſtrange in it ſelf, the Man was not much the better, nor the World wiſer,</p>
                  <p>But many of their Books of Devotion are worſe then ridiculous; for there are frequently ſuch paſſages and prayers as I cannot tell how to vindicate from <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry. Saint Bonaventur's Pſalter</hi> both in <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> I mentioned before, in which there are I believe a thouſand ſuch Prayers to her, or Expreſſions concerning her, which I confeſs I could not with a ſafe Conſcience ſay of any Creature. And <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> the Maſter of St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> hath not only 12 Books of the Praiſes of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> but alſo a diſtinct Book called <hi>Biblia Mariana,</hi> in which he applies ſeveral places of Scripture to the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> as if ſhe were prefigured in ſeveral paſſages of the Old Teſtament as well as her Son: So <hi>Gen. 1. 1. that ſhe was that Heaven that God made.</hi> Gen. 1. 3. <hi>She was the Light which God there made,</hi> and ſo on through almoſt the whole Scripture: And however Cautious they are in the Books which they Print in Engliſh for the uſe of their Converts here: yet in them we find often ſuch ſayings to or of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> as I cannot reconcile with Chriſtianity; for ſo in the <hi>Manual</hi> quoted before, in the Prayers for Women with Child they ſing thus to her.</p>

For ſo the wary council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Images,</hi> ſayes They are to be <hi>kept, and due Honour and Veneration paid to them:</hi> And though by and by they ſeem as if they would limit this Honour, yet preſently they put in ſuch words as make that pretended Limitation to ſignifie nothing: For they tell you. That <hi>whatever Honour you pay to the Image, goes to the perſon repreſented,</hi> (v. g. to our Saviour) it ſeems the Honour is paid to him whither we intend ſo or no: And hence you may eaſily gather what Honour is due to to the Image of our Saviour, and how little fear there is of paying too much Honour to it: For I ſuppoſe we are all agreed there is no fear of paying too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our bleſſed Saviour; and whatever Honour is paid to his Im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98824:151"/> it is very rare to hear of any perſon cenſured or blamed for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much Honour to Images, though ſurely it is as poſſible for men to be Idolaters now as in the former Ages; and I ſuppoſe that neither the common people, nor all the Prieſts are Men of ſuch extraordinary Underſtanding and Learning, as to be altogether free from the like Temptation. Nay, the Caution which is given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And by what this Council ſayes, the Prieſt underſtands well enough what it intends; and therefore ſcarcelie ever dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gular in our own, as well as to deſpiſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Devotions. And in order hereunto. I reckon that theſe four things are eſpecially to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That among us none but the true Object of Devotion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be worſhipped. God the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, none of the moſt bleſſed Angels, or Saints in Heaven being ever invocked, or adored by us. For we look on them only as our Brethren, and Members of the ſame Church with us, triumphing indeed whilſt we are here below ſtill in our Warfare. We thank God for them; and keep Feaſts in the Memory of them, at the ſame time praiſing God for his Goodneſs and Grace beſtowed on them, and ſhining forth in them, and alſo ſtirring up our ſelves by ſuch Commemorations to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their good Example, and this we think is as much as is due from us to our fellow Creatures, and believe that neither God allows, nor do they expect more from us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Only <hi>proper expreſſions of Devotion,</hi> are commanded or
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98824:151"/> allowed by our Church. For the matter of them they are ſuch as God himſelf hath required to be ſerved by, are ſignificant of that diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind which we know God accepts, and have an aptneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to the producing of that temper in us which God intends to work us up to by them: We uſe all the Inſtances of Devotion which they of the Church of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> uſe, if they be either neceſſary or fit; though indeed often to other and better purpoſe. We <hi>pray</hi> conſtantlie, but only for the <hi>living;</hi> for we look on the <hi>Dead</hi> as paſt the means of Grace, and conſequentlie paſt the benefit of our Prayers. We <hi>praiſe</hi> God for his Excellencies in himſelf, and <hi>thank</hi> him for his Goodneſs to others as well as to our ſelves: We practiſe <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Sins to God in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and in private, and adviſe it to be made alſo to the Miniſters of Gods Word, when it is neceſſary for Ghoſtly Council and Advice, for the ſatisfying of their Conſciences, and the removal of Scruple, and Doubtfulneſs: but we cannot ſay it is neceſſary to be made to <hi>Men</hi> in order to the Pardon of God: We reckon it rather as a priviledge or advantage then a Duty. And if Men will not make uſe of this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as often as there is Occaſion unleſs we tell a lye to advance the credit of it, we cannot help that. We enjoyn <hi>Faſtings</hi> and diſallow not of <hi>Penances,</hi> but adviſe People to take an holy revenge on themſelves when they have ſinned; but not as the Papiſts do to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for their ſins, or <hi>merit</hi> at Gods hand, but to ſhew the ſincerity of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to ſtrengthen their Reſolutions of amendement; for it is our amendement, and not our puniſhment which God is pleaſed with. And we take care that all theſe things be performed in a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, proportionably to the ſtrength of the Perſon, and the Nature and Deſign of the Duty; but are afraid of ſtraining them too high, leſt men ſhould be altogether deterred from them, or acquieſce only in the outward Action, or render our ſelves and our Cauſe ridiculous by an imprudent management. We have the Sacraments duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, as our Saviour commanded them; we reckon our Baptiſm with Water perfect without Oyl or Spittle: We grutch not the cup to the Laity, nor celebrate ſolitary Communions, nor admire whiſpering to God in the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, but as we have received from Chriſt, ſo we teach and adminiſter, without Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Diminution of any thing eſſential or material. In ſhort, in the holy Offices themſelves, and the behaviour which our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires they be celebrated with, there is alwayes a great propriety obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, agreeable to the command of God in Scripture, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles and firſt Ages of the Church, proper to the ſeveral parts of divine Worſhip, expreſſive of our Senſe, conſonant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the uſe of the World, eſpecial reſpect being alwayes had to the exciting of Piety and Devotion in the minds and carriage of our
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98824:152"/> fully afforded and preſſed on Men. For we not only have all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in a Language which the meaneſt People underſtand, but have it ſo contrived by frequent Reſponſes, that every Perſon bears a part in that Worſhip which he is ſo much concerned in, and doth not only hear the Prieſt ſpeak to God Almighty, but prayes for himſelf, and is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to joyn his aſſent to every ſhort Prayer by a diſtinct <hi>Amen.</hi> With us the ſame Service and Rules of Life are enjoyned to all, all Men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Concern in another Life however different their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Concerns are in this Life. We have conſtant Prayers in every Pariſh weekly at leaſt, in many dayly, with the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body and Blood of Chriſt frequently adminiſtred, nay every <hi>Sunday,</hi> not only in Cathedrals, but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And we teach our People that every Man muſt work for himſelf, for he that prayes only by a proxy, it is very juſt that he ſhould be rewarded only by a Proxy too; we put our People in mind that an unfeigned Repentance is abſolutely Neceſſary, and not a Verbal one only: That it is out of our power, and of any Man's in the World to turn <hi>Attrition</hi> into <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</hi> We pretend not to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with any for not obeying the Command of God. We have no <hi>Taxa Camere</hi> by which the Papiſts are ſhewn how all ſins are fined in their Church; for in that Book Men ſee at what Charge they may kill a Father, or commit Inceſt with their Siſters: But we aſſure all, that <hi>the Wages of ſin is Death,</hi> Death Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, if indulged and not moſt earneſtly repented of. And we tell all that Devotion is neceſſary for all, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath wayes of gratifying every Inclination, ſo as they that will not lead a ſtrict Life, need not, and yet may have hopes of Salvation: We own their Policy in this Contrivance, but do not ſo much admire their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious regard to the Salvation of Mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, though we thus forcibly preſs all Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on all Men; yet at the ſame time we warn them not to pretend to Merit Heaven at God's Hand; but after they have done their beſt; to confeſs they are <hi>unprofitable ſervants.</hi> Wee ſay of our Charity or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe we do in Obedience to God, that <hi>of his own we give to him,</hi> and we are bound to thank him both for the will and the Ability to give. The moſt that we pretend to', is onlie to make a ſmall Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by way of Sacrifice for what we have received; we beg of God to accept it as a Teſtimonie of a grateful Mind, and we know that his Goodneſs is ſo great, that he will abundantlie reward an honeſt and ſincere ſervant, though he hath done no more then was his Duty: And we hope that what we offer though ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with many Imperfections, he will be pleaſed to accept for the ſake of Chriſt as if it were perfect.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Grounds that we go on in our Devotions' and whatever we do for the Honour of God; and thus deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thus acting and perſiſting, we need not doubt but the

                     <head>I. <hi>What's the profeſt Doctrine and Practice of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as to Invocation of Saints.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AN Account of this I ſhall give you firſt in general, as it is ſet down in the decree of the <hi>Trent</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Council, and then lay it before you more at large diſtributed under ſeveral particulars.</p>
                     <p>In the twenty fifth Seſſion of that pack'd Synod we have its decree in theſe words; <hi>That all Biſhops and Paſtors that have the cure of ſouls do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently inſtruct their Flock that it's good and profitable, Humbly to pray unto the Saints, and to have recourſe to their prayers, help and aid;</hi> And then to reinforce the Obligation of it, it denounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all thoſe who ſhall find fault with it, or refuſe to practiſe it; ſo that now whoſoever ſhall be ſo hardy as to think and teach the contrary, to ſay, that either it ought not to be done, or that it's a fooliſh thing to do it; that the practice is little leſs then Idolatry, repugnant to the Glory of God as ſole Governour of the World, and highly injurious to the Honour of Chriſt as the only Mediator betwixt God and Man, does in the judgment of that Church, <hi>think impiouſly;</hi> and if the Popes Power as well as his Infallibility does not fail him, he moſt be Curſ'd and Damn'd for it. But, for once, not to be frighted with his vain Thunder, I ſhall proceed in due place by Gods aſſiſtance to prove all the foregoing particulars againſt it, when I have given you yet a fuller deſcription of it. Firſt, then,</p>
                     <p>1. The leaſt and moſt excuſable thing in this Doctrine and practice, is, to pray to Saints to pray for them. Thus much is not only confeſt by them, but made the pretence to bring off this Doctrine without the charge of Idolatry and Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Worſhip; We do no more in praying to Saints departed, ſay they, then one living Chriſtian does to another, when he ſayes, pray Sir, pray for me, or remember me in your prayers. But, was this indeed the true meaning of ſuch Devotions, it's ſo far from being any juſtification of them, that the Apologly it ſelf is ſinful, and admitting the excuſe, the practice no leſs to be condemned: For,</p>
                     <p>When they Pray to Saints departed to pray for them, thoſe Saints do either hear their prayers and become acquainted with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or they do not; If they do hear all thoſe prayers that are put up to them at the ſame time by innumerable perſons, and that in far diſtant places. what's this but to aſcribe to them that <hi>ubiquity</hi> and <hi>omnipreſence,</hi> that's ſolely, peculiarly and incommunicably in God? If they do not, then it's very abſurd and ridiculous, and a great abuſe of that reaſon God hath given men for other ends then
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98824:155"/> to triflle with, to Pray to them. For, to what purpoſe ſhould they Pray to them that can't hear them? Why ſhould they beſeech thoſe to be their Advocates to God and recommend their particular caſes to him, whoſe caſes they cannot, by any way that we know of, come to underſtand? As for their Learning and ſeeing all things in the Glaſs of the Trinity, or learning them by particular revelation from God; as God has declared no ſuch thing to us, ſo is it not to be known by the Light of Nature, but the contrary is very probable, if not certain; as ſhall be made to appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Diſcourſe. It is not denyed but that bleſſed Spirits who are ſafely landed upon the Shore, do pray for their Partners who are ſtill behind beating it on the Waves; it is not denied but that Saints in Heaven may Pray in particular to God for their Friends and Relations, whoſe neceſſities and infirmities they were well acquainted with before they left the Body; ſo 'twas agreed betwixt St <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that who went firſt to Glory, ſhould be mindful of the others condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God; for, why ſhould their Memories or their Charity be thought to be leſs in Heaven then they were on Earth; We know 'twas the practice of ſome good Men in the Primitive times to recommend themſelves to the Prayers of the Saints, that is, to deſire God to hear the Prayers that the Saints in Heaven did make in their behalf; and to apply themſelves to the Martyrs a little before their ſuffering, when they themſelves were entred into bliſs, to interceed with God for thoſe who were yet on the way paſſing thither with fear and trembling. But now is there no difference betwixt the Saints interceſſions for us and our Invocation of them? Betwixt their Praying for us in Heaven and our Praying to them on Earth? Is there no difference betwixt one Living Chriſtian Praying to another to Pray for him, who hears his requeſt and who is acquainted with his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our addreſſing to Saints departed to pray for us, who know us not, and who are are ignorant of our ſtate?</p>
                     <p>Again, when they pray to Saints departed, they do it with all the Rites and Solemnities of a Religious Worſhip, in ſacred offices, upon their Knees, with uncovered Heads, with Hands and Eyes lifted up, in times and places dedicated to Gods Worſhip; now, though it ſhould be true, that they do no more then Pray to Saints to pray for them, yet doing it in that manner, with ſuch external Acts of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are confeſt to be the ſame wherewith we call on God, I do not ſee, how they can be excuſed, even on this account, from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing that Honour to the Creature which is due only to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. As God is owned to be infinite in himſelf, and to have incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable perfections, ſo there ought to be ſome peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Acts and ſigns of Worſhip to ſignify that we do inwardly ſo eſteem and believe of God, and when theſe are once determined by
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98824:155"/> the Law of God or the univerſal reaſon and conſent of Mankind, the applying them to any elſe but him, is a plain violating his peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and robbing him of his Honour. And now in this reſpect alſo I cannot diſcern how the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Invocation of Saints is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with our requeſting our Fellow-Members to pray for us? For (not to mention again the preſence of theſe, and the abſence of the other) is there no difference betwixt my deſiring an eminently good Chriſtian to pray for me, and falling down on my Knees with Hands and Eyes lifted up, and that in a Temple, to him, with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt? Would not every good Man that has any regard for the Honour of God preſently ſhew his deteſtation of ſuch an action? Would he not ſay to me as St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> falling down before him, <hi>Stand up, I my ſelf alſo am a Man?</hi> Would he not with St. <hi>Paul</hi> have rent his Garments and with much Holy indignation cryed out to me, as he to the Men of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> deſigning the ſame Honours to him and <hi>Barnabas</hi> wherewith they Worſhip'd their Gods, <hi>Why do ye theſe things, we alſo are Men of like Paſſions with you?</hi> As the Saints in Heaven cannot be ſuppoſed to loſe any thing of their Love and Charity towards their Fellow-Members by going thither, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they be thought to abate any thing of their Zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the honour of God; and therefore certainlie what they did and would have refuſed here on Earth, they muſt with higher degrees of abhorrence reject now they are in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if this be all they mean by all their ſeveral Offices of Devotions to Saints departed that they ſhould pray for them unto God, why in all this time that theſe forms have been complained of, has not the ſenſe of them been better expreſt? Whence, I pray, ſhould we take the meaning of ſuch prayers but from the uſual ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Words? But, if not; why has no Inquiſition paſt upon them? Why have not the groſſeſt and rankeſt for Superſtition and encroaching on the prerogative of God, been expunged and blotted out? Why all this while has there been no review, no comments upon them, no cautions and inſtructions written and bound up with their Breviaries, Roſaries and Hours, that the people might know how to underſtand them? If the form of words in their Saint-Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the ſame that is uſed to God, but their ſenſe and meaning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; Why don't they tell this to the World and make their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as publick and as general as the prayers?</p>
                     <p>Certainlie, the Biſhops and Governours of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and thoſe that have the care of Souls amongſt them, are either guilty of groſs and willfull neglects to the people; or elſe, whatever they ſay to us, their will is, that the People ſhould underſtand thoſe Prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtomary and received uſe of the words; and then <hi>I</hi> am ſure they pray, not only to ſaints to pray for them unto God, in order
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98824:156"/> to the obtaining of him ſuch aids and ſupplies they want, but to Saints themſelves for thoſe very bleſſings. As will appear at large in the next particular.</p>
                     <p>2. They pray to Saints departed for thoſe very bleſſings that none but God can give. To what purpoſe elſe do they adviſe us to fly, not only to their prayers, but <hi>their help and aſſiſtance;</hi> which words, <hi>help and aſſiſtance,</hi> would have been <note place="margin">Ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To what purpoſe elſe do they Pray to <hi>viſit</hi> them, <hi>to make haſte and come</hi> to them, did they not expect ſome other aid and aſſiſtance from them then bare praying for them? for that certainly might have been better and more convenientlie performed in Heaven, before the Face of God.</p>
                     <p>To what purpoſe elſe in ſome particular caſes do they put up their Addreſſes to one Saint rather then to another, according as in this World they were famous, either for ſome eminent Grace ſhining in them, or for ſome ſtrange cure or extraordinary deliverance wrought by them, but onlie, that they believe and truſt, that thoſe, who did ſuch great things on Earth, are much more willing and able to do them now they are in Heaven, where, while other Graces ceaſe, Charity and Beneficence are perfected and abide for ever?</p>
                     <p>Thus becauſe St. <hi>Roch</hi> was ſignally Charitable in aſſiſting thoſe who were infected with the plague, therefore do they call upon him in times of infection; becauſe St. <hi>Appollonia</hi> had all her Teeth ſtruck out for her undaunted Confeſſion of the Faith of Jeſus, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do they fly to her for eaſe againſt the Rage of Teeth; becauſe St, <hi>George</hi> was by profeſſion a Souldier and renowned for wonderful Atchievements, therefore have they recourſe to him for aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Enemies. 'Tis true, was it Lawfull to Addreſs to any at all, this might be a ſufficient reaſon, why they Addreſs to this rather then to another Saint, becauſe his or her former actions or ſufferings do beſt ſuit and befit their preſent caſe; but, being not ſure that theſe and ſuch like Canoniz'd Saints of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, being ſure, if they are, they can't hear us, nor know our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular State, much leſs beſtow health and deliverance upon us, whileſt we Love and Honour the Memory of Saints indeed, we ought to call only upon God, who only is <hi>a preſent help in time of need</hi> and <hi>the Saviour of them that put their truſt in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to put this out of doubt, it will not be amiſs to ſet down ſome of their forms of Devotion to Saints departed; And here not to rake for them in ſome obſcure Authors that have privately ſtole into the World, I ſhall need go no farther then the preſent Roman Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary

Nay, had our Saviour and his Apoſtles intended this Saint-Invocation as a neceſſary Chriſtian Duty; it would have needed a more expreſs command and penalty to have inforced its obligation, then moſt other Duties of Chriſtianity, ſince it was altogether a thing new to the <hi>Jews</hi> and what had never been practiſed by them; for though ſometimes in their prayers to God, they beſought him to remember <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <note place="margin">Luk 1. 55. 72. 73.

                     </p>
                     <p>But to blunt the edge of this Argument that they themſelves have put into our hands againſt it, they tell us, was not for any intrinſick Evil in the thing, but for ſome particular reaſons relating to the times of the Old Teſtament, and the firſt Ages of the New that It was not mentioned and enioyned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but if the reaſons produced by them do hold with equal force againſt it promiſcuouſly in all Ages, as well as againſt it then, certainly the main reaſon why it's no where preſcribed in ſcripture, is, that it might at no time be put in practice. The reaſons they give are chiefly two.</p>
                     <p>For the Old Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſay it's not there enjoyned, becauſe the Patriarchs and Saints departed, during that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, were not admitted into the beatifick Viſion, and ſo could not ordinarily underſtand the Prayers of the Living; but, if for ought we know, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> are ſtill in the ſame <hi>Limbo,</hi> or place of reſt they went to at firſt, or, if, our Saviour at his aſcenſion into Heaven did give them a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py deliverance and took them up with him into the immediate preſence of God, 'tis not certain, that they underſtand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Living any more then they did before, then there is as much reaſon not to Invocate them now, as there was not to do it then. Many of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not have the Saints in Heaven come to know the deſires of their Living Votaries by the benefit of the beaufick Viſion which they enjoy, but by particular Revelation from God, and if ſo, then the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthies were as capable of it, and conſequentlie there was as much reaſon to pray unto them before our Saviours coming, when they were but in Paradiſe, as afterwards when by his Glorious Victory and Triumph over Death they were exalted
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98824:161"/> into Heaven, ſince God could have revealed the requeſts of their ſupplicants alike to them in all places, in one as well as another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, conſidering the great eſteem and veneration the <hi>Jews</hi> ever had for thoſe great Men, the Founders of their Nation, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, Joſhua</hi> and others, had there been no evil in the thing, no reaſon can be given why it was not preached to the <hi>Jews</hi> by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles as the moſt likely argument to win them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>For the New Teſtament they ſay, 'tis not there enjoyned, becauſe it would have been a great offence and ſcandal to the new converted Gentiles, and have given them an occaſion to think, that they had only changed their Gods but not their Religion, that the Chriſtian Doctrine was only a device of the Apoſtles to thruſt out their old <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> and to put in themſelves; that as thoſe had hitherto been Worſhip'd for the great ſervices and benefactions they did in this preſent World, ſo they for the future might have the ſome Honour done them for the full diſcoveries they had made, and excellent directions they had given, relating to a future and more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State.</p>
                     <p>And is not this a good Argument and does it not hold ſtill againſt <hi>Romiſh</hi> Invocation? Is it not of as much force now to caſt it out of the Church as it was then not to bring it in? Does it not give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite offence to a great part of the Chriſtian World, and is it not eſteem'd, and that juſtly by them, to be the old Pagan-Worſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, or ſomething very near it? For, it is not enough to excuſe them from it that the object of their Inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cation is not the ſame, that they do not with them pay this Worſhip to the Heathen Deities, (who, though in ſome reſpects they had been Patrons and Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to their Country, were yet in others very lewd and unworthy perſons,) but to the Apoſtles of Chriſt and Chriſtians Martyrs (who in all reſpects were highly deſerving of the World) whilſt they agree in the ſame act &amp; kind of Worſhip and give that Honour to the Creature which properly and peculiarly belongs to God, and herein eſpecially did the Pagan Worſhip and Superſtition conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>2. We ſhall now examine the chief of thoſe Texts the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> produce in the behalf of this Doctrine, and let you ſee how little they ſerve to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, <hi>Luke 15. 7. 10. There ſhall be joy in Heaven;</hi> and again, <hi>There ſhall be joy before the Angels of God, over our Sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> From whence they argue, that if Angels and bleſſed ſpirits rejoyce at the Converſion of a ſinner, they muſt know and underſtand this change that's wrought in them before they can rejoyce at it, and if the knowledge of their repentance reaches them, why not alſo of their Prayers? And then if they can hear their Prayers,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98824:161"/> why may they not be Prayed unto? To this it's anſwered,</p>
                     <p>That this rejoycing in Heaven is not for the Converſion of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinner, but in general for the Redemption of Mankind by Jeſus Chriſt, and this appears more then probable from the parable of the loſt ſheep immediately going before, whereof theſe words are the Concluſion; the Ninety nine ſheep not loſt are the Angels preſevering in their firſt ſtate of Innocency; the ſheep that went aftray, <hi>Adam</hi> and in him all his Poſterity that fell from God; the ſhepherd that went to ſeek the loſt ſheep, God himſelf, who ſent his Son into the World to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt, on whoſe ſhoulders the great Work of Mans Redemption was laid; and for this we are ſure there was joy in Heaven, when a Bleſſed Chore of Angels ſung that Heavenly Anthem at Chriſts Nativity, <hi>Glory be to God on high, and on Earth Peace good will towards Men</hi> But</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing this rejoycing is to be underſtood for the repentance of individual ſinners, it may be obſerved. <note place="margin">Emopion to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If this Text does imply that Angels in Heaven know when a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is converted and rejoyce at it, it does not follow that they know this by ſome excellent priviledge and perfection of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby alſo they are enabled to underſtand even thoſe mental Prayers, that we are told ought to be put up to them; but paſſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes betwixt Heaven and Earth (as wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That we are no more ſure of the Knowledge of Angels in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, then we are of that of Saints, and therefore the one ought to be proved before the other be granted.

If the ſtory ſhould be true that <hi>Juſtina</hi> a Chriſtian Virgin did in great diſtreſs jointly ſupplicate the bleſſed Virgin with God and Chriſt, does it follow, that it was the practice of all to do ſo? It cannot be denied but that many of the Fathers let ſlip, in the heat of their Affection and Oration, many unwary ſpeeches to this purpoſe, and that many, otherwiſe good Men, were guilty of this exceſs of Devotion to the Martyrs; the many miracles God was pleaſed to work at the Memorials of the Martyrs for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Confirmation of the Faith, reaſonably begat a cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

But now</p>
                     <p>We are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſpeeches of ſome particular Fathers and the general Doctrine of the Church, betwixt what they expreſs in Rhetorical ſtrains to move affection, and what they lay down in plain terms to inform the judgement; betwixt what comes from them in the heat of their Diſcourſes and popular Orations, and what in cool and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate debates they ſet down for the truth of Chriſt; it's generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Fathers of times hyperbolize, particularly S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and we muſt not take their flights of Fancy, for the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                     <p>We are to diſtinguiſh alſo betwixt what the Church did teach and allow, and what ſhe only tolerated and was forced to bear with; the Biſhops and Governours of the Church being many times engaged in weightier mattersin defending the Chriſtian cauſe again Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Hereticks, were not alwayes at leiſure to reform abuſes and irregular practices, but were forced too often to connive at thoſe Faults which they had not time and opportunity to redreſs; St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> complains much of this piece <note place="margin">

They cite the practice of the Ancients Praying to God, that for the Interceſſion of thoſe Holy Men that had died in the Lord, he would grant them their requeſts, as a good proof for direct Praying to them. The Ancients generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Saints and Martyrs in the future ſtate did continually Pray to God in behalf of the Church Militant on Earth, and ſome, that their Souls were preſent at their Shrines and Tombs, and did joyn their Interceſſions with thoſe Prayers of the Chriſtians that were there offered up to God, were wont in their addreſſes to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Martyrs, and to beg the effects of their Interceſſions, that God would be moved by their ſupplications as well as their own, to grant a ſupply of their wants and neceſſities; but this is no more Praying to them, then <hi>Moſes</hi> may be ſaid to Pray to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he beſought God to remember them in behalf of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> then we may be ſaid to Pray for help to that part of the Church of Chriſt that is at a great diſtance from us, when we deſire God to hear the Prayers of his Church Catholick

Thus our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>I and the Father are one;</hi> yea, the whole Thre Perſons are ſo, <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7.</note> as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us expreſly, <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> We read that 'twas the <note place="margin">

                     <p n="3">3. We may conſider that this Doctrine of the Trinity, being in a great meaſure a ſtranger to the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles, when our Saviour gave them this Prayer, not ſufficiently inſtructed in it, our Saviour might teach them to call upon God in ſuchh an expreſſion; which, though for the preſent they might underſtand only of God the Father, yet afterwards when they ſhould come more
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98824:168"/> fully to underſtand and beleive the Trinity, might fairly be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take in the other two perſons, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Since it is by vertue of our Spiritual relation to God by Chriſt, through the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, that in a more ſpecial and particular manner he is Our Father; when ever we call upon God <hi>as a Father, and Our Father,</hi> it implies that we addreſs to him in the Name and Mediation of Chriſt, and by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; the Apoſtle tells believers that they had received <hi>the Spirit of Adoption, wherby they cried</hi> Abba <hi>Father:</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s notion on the Text is, that the <hi>Jews</hi>

                     <p>Another evident proof are thoſe words of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5. There is one God and and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The natural importance of the words ſeems to be this, that, as there is but one God only, and no more, to whom we ought to Pray, ſo there is but one Mediatour only, and no more by whom we have acceſs with boldneſs to the Thron of Grace; <hi>one Mediatour</hi> Emphatically, in the ſame ſenſe as there is <hi>one God,</hi> and you may as well make to your ſelves more Gods as more Mediators.</p>
                     <p>But to weaken the ſtrength of this evidence, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> diſtinguiſh betwixt a Mediator of Redemption and a Mediator of Interceſſion, and tell us that the Text is only to be underſtood of the former, which indeed is but one, but not of the latter, which may be more then one, even as many as there are Angels and Saints in Heaven; but how little this diſtinction does ſerve their turn, may appear by conſidering.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is a vaſt difference betwixt an Interceſſor and a Mediator of Interceſſion; that Saints in Heaven, out of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that all the Members of Chriſt have for one another, do in general interceed for the good of that Body of which they are a part, was owned and granted before; but this makes them not Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of Interceſſion, to which office it belongs to receive the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others, and to preſent them to God; and in order hereunto, they muſt hear the Prayers of others, and receive information concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their particular States and Conditions, which they are not capable of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this Text is eſpecially to be underſtood of that part of Chriſts Mediatory Office that conſiſts in interceeding for us; the Apoſtle
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98824:168"/> ſeems to oppoſe theſe words to the Heathen Form of Praying, which was to many Gods by many <hi>Doemons,</hi> who were reputed Agents or Mediatours between their chief Gods and them; now all that the Heathens attributed to their <hi>Doemons</hi> was Interceſſion only and the Apoſtle ſhews that Chriſt being made a Mediatour, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way effectual for that end, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>re could be no neceſſity of any Mediatours of Interceſſion beſides him; ſo that the Apoſtle here. replyes two things to the Heathens multiplicity of Mediatours; 1. That God had appointed but one, the God-Man Chriſt Jeſus; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayes, ver. 7. that he was <hi>ordained a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity,</hi> for eſtabliſhing the Chriſtian Faith and Truth in this particular eſpecially, of <hi>one God and one Mediatour,</hi> in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the plurality of Gods and Mediatours amongſt the Gentiles; anſwerable to this are thoſe words of the Apoſtle in another place, <hi>Though there be many that are called Gods (as there be Gods many and Lords many) but to us there is but one</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>God the Father and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> here there is a manifeſt and direct oppoſition betwixt the Heathen way of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Chriſtian; the Heathens had many Gods and many Lords Mediatours, the Chriſtians, but one God, and one Lord Mediatour; the Heathens had many Soveraign Gods betwixt whom and Men they ſuppoſed there was no immediate intercourſe; they had alſo many under Gods or <hi>Doemons,</hi> by whoſe Agency and Mediatourſhip they addreſt themſelves to their Soveraign Gods, this the Apoſtle confutes, and ſhews that Chriſtians are taught to believe and profeſs but one God, Maker of all things to whom they ought to Pray, and but one Lord, Mediatour and Advocate, by whom they offer their Petitions to him. 2. That there needed no other beſides this one, he being a Mediator of Redemption too, and on that account had not only an Authority and Commiſſion from God to ſhew for that office, but an infinite worth and invaluable merits of his own to plead in behalf of Mankind and to procure the gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A third Scripture againſt Saint-Invocation are thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. Taken out of <hi>Deut. 6. 13.

                     <p n="1">1. If theſe words, <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> are to be underſtood only of the higheſt degree of Religious worſhip, as a part of the whole, and diſtinguiſh'd from a lower kind, they had not been a ſufficient anſwer to the Devils demand; he might thus have anſwered, <hi>I</hi> acknowledge the Soveraign and Almighty Power of God as well as you, <hi>That it is he alone can command</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 3,</note> 
                        <hi>Stones to become Bread;</hi> and this Power I have over the Kingdoms of the World, I own to have received from him, <hi>for it was delivered to me.</hi> And therefore I do not <note place="margin">Luke 4. 6.</note> deſire that thou ſhouldeſt Worſhip me as thou doeſt God with <hi>Latreia,</hi> with the higheſt degree of worſhip; but only with <hi>Duleia,</hi> a lower kind; thy Heart, the higheſt and moſt elevated thoughts and conceptions of thy mind, may be given to God, 'tis only the outward Act that I challenge of thee, that thou wouldeſt only <hi>fall down and Worſhip me,</hi> or by <hi>falling down worſhip Me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Scriptures often uſe theſe two words, <hi>Latreia,</hi> and <hi>Duleia,</hi> promiſcuouſly, to ſignify the ſame thing; and as ſometimes <hi>Latreia,</hi> is ſet to ſignify that Civil Honour and Service that's due to Men in Eminency and Authority; ſo is <hi>Duleia,</hi> to expreſs that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip that's only due to God. As to the firſt, God <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 48.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98824:169"/> Apoſtles urged Chriſtians to be fervent in Spirit, <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord,</hi> and when our Saviour ſaid, ye <hi>cannot</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. That there is no, ſuch diſtinction in Religious worſhip as an higher and lower kind, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Religious worſhip is ſuch, with reſpect to God only as the Object, and therefore can be but one, and that in the higheſt degree, as God is one, and infinitely exalted above all. <hi>Religion,</hi> ſay the School-Men, <hi>is a Moral Vertue which exhibits due Worſhip to God, as the</hi>

                        <hi>Principal of all things. Lactantius</hi> therefore derives it <hi>a Religando,</hi> becauſe it ties Man to God; and St. <hi>Auſtin, à Religendo</hi> becauſe Men chooſe God again whom they had forſaken; 'Tis not therefore whatſoever is excellent, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Divine, and as it is Divine, that is the Object of Religion; now Angels and Holy Men, although there be ſome kind of Honour due to thoſe excellencies, that are found in them, an Honour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to thoſe excellencies; yet falling infinitely ſhort of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt be excluded from having any ſhare of that worſhip, which either by God himſelf, or the univerſal conſent of Mankind, is made Religious, that is, appropriate to God. Neither.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Will it help the matter to ſay, that though the outward Acts and Expreſſions of worſhip to both are the ſame, there is a vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the inward Devotions of their minds and Souls, and that which they Pray to Saints and Angels, they muſt not be thought to do it, with that height of Affection, and truſt and reſignation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they call upon God? For, when all is done, words and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts will be reckon'd to ſignify according to that ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtom and Inſtitution hath ſtamp'd upon them, and let the inward thoughts of the Votary be what they will, if he apply to Saints and Angels in ſuch expreſſions and offices or with ſuch Rites and Ceremonies, as according to the uſual acceptation of them, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally import that Hope and Confidence, that Love and Duty, that is due to God alone, he will be deem'd to aſcribe unto them, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally import that Hope and Confidence, that Love and Duty, that is due to God alone, he will be deem'd to aſcribe unto them, the Honour which he owes to God. Outward Acts of worſhip are declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the inward reſpect and veneration of the Soul to God, as words are of the inward thoughts and apprehenſions of the mind; and, as when I uſe ſuch words, which acording to common cuſtom ſignify ſuch a Propoſition, I muſt be concluded to mean and intend that Propoſition; ſo when I uſe ſuch outward Acts of Worſhip, which by Cuſtom or Inſtitution ſignify the Honour due to God, to any other, I muſt be thought to aſcribe the Honour that's due to God, to that other.

'Tis by this bleſſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge eſpecially, of ſeing God, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ground their belief, that the perfected Spirits of juſt Men in Heaven come to ſee all things in him, to know the Petitions and to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the requeſts of their humble Supplicants; but now the Primitive Fathers have peremptorly affirmed, that the Saints depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not yet admitted to the ſight of God, but are only kept in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hidden receptacles in the full enjoyment of Peace and reſt till the general Reſurrection; this they have not only aſſerted in ſo many words, and endeavoured to <note place="margin">Iren. l. 5. c. 31.</note> prove, from our Saviours Soul being in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which they will not have to be the higheſt Heaven; but thinking them in a condition not yet fully and compleatly happy, inſtead of Invocating them <note place="margin">Chryſoſ.

One chief Argument which the Primitive Fathers uſed to prove the Divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> was the Catholick practice of the Church in Praying to them, which would not have been of any force, had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that any Creatures, though never ſo highly exalted in Nature and Condition, might have had that Honour payed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

Had the Catholicks at the ſame time practiſed the Invocation of Saints, the charge might have been returned with greater force upon themſelves, and whatever could have been thought of by the Catholicks to excuſe themſelves from that guilt, might with more ſtrength have been urged by the <hi>Arians</hi> in their behalf. Had the Catholicks replied, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do now, that though they did
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98824:171"/> Pray to the bleſſed Spirits, yet they did not do it with that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, direct and final Prayer, nor with thoſe Sublimeſt Thoughts and intentions of Honour, wherewith they did addreſs to God, but only with indirect, ſubaltern and relative Prayer, and with no higher intentions of Honour to them, then what is proportioned to the excellencies of their finite nature; the <hi>Arrians</hi> might have returned upon them with great advantage; even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, <hi>Sirs,</hi> and with the ſame due limitations do we Invocate the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and whilſt we do no more but ſo, we have more reaſon for what we do then you can have, ſince Chriſt is confeſſedly ſuperiour to all Creatures, and conſequently deſerves at leaſt as great an Honour to be paid to him as unto any the higheſt amongſt them, though we do not think him God equal with the Father, yet the Scripture aſſures <hi>us he is exalted far above all Angels, Principalities and Powers and every name which is named in Heaven and Earth;</hi> and though we may not Honour the Son in the ſame high degree with an <hi>as</hi> of equality as we do the Father, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyns us to do it with the ſame kind of Honour, with an <hi>as</hi> of ſimilitude and likeneſs; and this is more then can be ſaid in defence of that Honour and Invocation you offer to Saints and Angels.</p>

                     <head>VII. <hi>That the Doctrine and Practice of Saint-Invocation is Impious and Idolatrous.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis, I think, will be fully made out from theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p>1. This aſcribes to Angels and Saints the Attributes and Perfections that are ſolely proper and peculiar to God, <hi>viz. his Omniſcience and Omnipreſence;</hi> for, not only, when Mental Prayers, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> directs, but (ſince the bleſſed Spirits above can't be ſuppoſed to eſpouſe the cauſe of an inſincere Votary) when vocal Prayers alſo are offered up to them, it ſuppoſes them Privy to the very thoughts, and acquainted with the Hearts of Men; again, when innumerable Prayers and Supplications from Millions of places at the greateſt diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from one another, are at the ſame time immediately put up to them, it ſuppoſes in like manner, that they are preſent in all places and at the ſame time can give Audience to all their Petitioners. Now what more or greater can be ſaid of God? Is not this that infinite knowledge, that Omnipreſent Power, and never abſent Nature that the Scriptures ſolely attribute to the Creator of all things, and have denied to any of the higheſt Form of the Creatures? And although, I will not undertake to deſcribe to you the exact bounds aad Meaſures of the Angelical Nature and Perfections, how perſpective their Knowledge is? How piercing their underſtanding? How ſwift their motion? Yet, ſure I am, that neither they nor any other the moſt elevated part of Gods Creation can by their Natural Power know the Hearts of Men, and be in all places at one inſtant of time. It is God alone whoſe underſtanding is infinite, who looks down from Heaven &amp; beholds all the wayes of the Sons of Men, <hi>He, even he knoweth all the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

                        <hi>deceitful above all things, and diſperatly Wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the Heart, and try the Reins.</hi> By this Argument the Fathers Triumph'd over the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> in proving the Divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, which yet would have been no Argument at all, had not this Knowledge been an Incommunicable perfection in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:98824:174"/>
                     <p>But 'tis ſaid, that 'tis God indeed that only <hi>Naturally, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> knows the Hearts o Men, but this hinders not, but that others, his Saints and Angels may know them by Communication from him, <hi>viz.</hi> Either by Revelation from God or by the Beatifick Viſion, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in God who ſees all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this, not to mention how it contradicts the expreſs words of Scripture, which, without any diſtinction or limitation, does as plainly aſſert as words can do it, <hi>That God only knows the Heart;</hi> not to mention the many diſputes the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have among themſelves which way is to be choſen as the moſt probable, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is either way this knowledge is derived and paſt from God to them; theſe things may be ſaid,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath no where declared that he hath Communicated this Priviledge and Prerogative of his Nature to Saints and Angels, or that he does any way make viſible or known to them the Hearts and the Requeſts of Men; and now, <hi>if what is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> we hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Text of Scripture to Build our Faith upon in this particular, muſt of neceſſity Sin in Praying to them on that ſuppoſition, and commit that very ſin too, which we doubt whither we ſo doing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or no; nay the ſilence of the Scripture in this particular, has in a manner determined the point, and we may conclude that the moſt jealous God, has reſerved the Honour of Intimation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, ſince he has no where given us the leaſt hint or intimation of leave, to pray to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We are informed in Scripture that the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted do not particularly know or mind what's done <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 28.</note> here below, <hi>God tells</hi> Joſiah. <hi>thou ſhalt be gathered to thy Grave in Peace, neither ſhall thine Eyes ſee the Evil I will bring upon this place.

                        <hi>Elijah</hi> was about to be taken up into Heaven, he thus ſpake to <hi>Eliſha, Ask what thou wilt before I am taken from thee.</hi> Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying that when he was once gone, 'twas in vain to ask any thing of him. <hi>Elijah</hi> was immediately taken up into Heaven, made no ſtay by the way <hi>in Limbo,</hi> as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, being in Heaven, his Love to <hi>Eliſha</hi> could not be forgot, nor his Intereſt in God leſſened, but rather both by being exalted thither, very much encreaſed and augmented; ſo that no reaſon can be given why he ſhould limit and fix his making his deſires known to him to the time of his abode with him on Earth, but only this, his perſwaſion that in the other State he ſhould not be capable to hear
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98824:175"/> his requeſts, and ſo all his future addreſſes to him would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.

They that will have God acquaint particular Saints and Angels with thoſe Petitions that are put up to them, impoſe a very Servile and Diſhonourable Office on God; and as ſometimes they will have us, out of Diſcretion and Humility go to God by Saints and Angels, as Men make their way to a Prince by his Favourites; now they make the King and his Subjects to change places, and God is ſent to wait on them with the requeſts of their Votaries. What can be more ſtrangely ridiculous then this Poſition of theirs? That the Petitioner muſt firſt make his ſute to Angels and Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or, when any one addreſſes to an Angel or Saint, to ſupplicate the bleſſed Virgin in his behalf, God muſt firſt tell this Angel or Saint, the contents of the Addreſs, then he muſt Poſt to the bleſſed Virgin, ſhe upon the firſt notice of it, muſt have recourſe to her Son, and he upon the motion of his Mother, repair to his Father, to preſent that requeſt to him which he himſelf fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4. Neither can the Angels and Spirits above know the Hearts and Petitions of their ſupplicants any more by vertue of the ſight of God, then by Revelation from him; this fond opinion depends upon this <hi>Romiſh</hi> gingle, <hi>That ſeeing God, they muſt in him ſee all things</hi> that in <hi>Idea</hi> are contained in him: but does not the Scripture aſſure us, <hi>That no one knows the things of God but the Spirit of God that is in him?</hi> Do they not tell us, how <note place="margin">1 cor. 2. 11.</note> ignorant the Angels were of the great Myſtery of Mans Redemption, notwithſtanding their nearneſs to God, <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 10.</note> and beholding his Face, <hi>Till it was made known to them by the church.</hi> Does not our Saviour let us know that <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> he himſelf as Man, though his Humanity was Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically

                     <p>2. This Doctrine and Practice is highly derogatory from the Glory of God as Governour of the World. God is the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, all that we are and all that we have we derive from him; we are upheld by his Power and maintained by his bounty and Goodneſs; <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being; he gives to all life and breath and all things;</hi> he numbers the hairs of our head, paints the Lillies of the Field beyond the Glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> feeds the young Ravens that call upon him, takes care of Sparrows; much more of Man, who is of a more worthy and excellent Nature, much more yet of Nations and Kingdoms who conſiſt of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Men linkt together by Laws and Government; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ſometimes when he pleaſes, he makes uſe of the Miniſtry of Angels, and makes them the Inſtruments of his Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſons of Men, yet he hath no where told us, that he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to them, much leſs to Saints departed, their ſeveral Provinces, or ſet them their particular tasks that he has made them Preſidents over ſuch Countries or Cities, Patrons and Guardians over ſuch perſons or profeſſions, that he has given them a power over ſuch and ſuch Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Diſeaſes; but, has reſerved the power of diſpenſing his kindneſſes, where, to whom, and in what meaſure, in his own hands; and therefore all our truſt and confidence ought intirely to be placed in God, all our Thanks and Praiſes are due to him, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is to be acknowledged as the Author and Donor of all our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; but now from that Preſidentſhip and protection, that power and patronage, that the <hi>Romaniſts intruding into theſe things they have not ſeen,</hi> without ſufficient ground <note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> aſcribe to Angels and Saints, over particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, perſons, and in particular Caſes and Circumſtances, (though as ſubſtitutes under God) ariſes naturally ſome degree of truſt and confidence in them, ſome debt of Homage and praiſe to them, and 'tis well if the perſon oblidged looks any higher in his returns of Love and Thankfulneſs then to that particular Angel or Saint he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and from whoſe deputed power and Authority he thinks he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his deliverance; and what is this but to rob God of the Honour of being ſole Governour of the World, and to make ſome of his Creatures who are no leſs beholding to him for their ſubſiſtence then the reſt, to partake with him of that Truſt and Affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what Wiſeman on Earth who is abundantly ſatisfied of the readineſs and ability of his Prince to help him, and hath free leave given him on any ocaſion to come, immediately, or by his Son, to him, will chooſe to wave this freedom of acceſs, and apply himſelf to ſome inferiour Officer and Favourite, (of whoſe Power and Intereſt he is not ſo well aſſured,) either to relieve him himſelf, or to procure relief of the King for him: This is our caſe, God is of infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, every way able on all occaſions to afford ſutable aids and ſupplies to the wants of his Creatures, hath not only allowed, but commanded all <hi>to call upon him in the day of trouble, to pour out their complaints to him,</hi> hath over and over promiſed <hi>to hear their Prayers and to anſwer them,</hi> hath appointed his own Son, God with himſelf, the Maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, from time to time to receive all the Petitions of his Subjects, and both the one and the other are infinitely more able, and infinitely more willing to hear and ſuccour them, then the Beſt and Wiſeſt and moſt Powerful of all Created beings; and ſhall we now be afraid to take the liberty that God hath given us?

                     <p>WEre we certain that the Saints departed do now reign in Heaven and enjoy the Beatifick Viſion, and that it was lawful to Invocate ſuch as are undoubtely Saints, as the Bleſſed Virgin and the Holy Apoſtles; Yet, methinks, a wary Man ſhould be ſhy, and not over-forward to exhibit that honour to all whom the Pope hath Cannoniz'd; I cannot for my heart but think, that the Prelates and Biſhops in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time had as much reaſon to Unſaint <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> for being a Rebel againſt his Prince, as Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third had to Canonize him for being a Biggot for the Church. What can a ſober Chriſtian think of the Saintſhip of ſome, who never had any being in the World, and of others who never had any goodneſs; many of their Saints are meer Names, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Perſons, and many meer Perſons, without Holineſs; nay, I am very confident that the greateſt Incendiaries and Diſturbers of the Peace of the World do as well deſerve it, as that famous Pope, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh. Inumerable might be inſtanc'd in, whoſe Saintſhip juſtly falls under great Suſpicion: but, 'tis enough
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:98824:178"/> that ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, and thoſe of no little Authority in their Church, have granted <hi>that the Popes canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are doubtful and ſubject to error;</hi> If then at any <note place="margin">Billar. de beat. ſanct. l. 1. c. 7. 8.</note> time his Infallibility ſhould chance to miſtake, as I am pretty ſure, he has more then once done, the Members of that Church are in a ſweet caſe, and are not only in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Invocating Saints, but Devils alſo, which is Idolatry with a witneſs, and by their own Confeſſion.</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE AGAINST TRANSUBSTANTIATION</head>
                  <p>COncerning the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> one of the two great poſitive Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Religion, there are two main Points of difference between <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome. One,</hi> about the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> in which they think, but are not certain, that they have the Scripture and the words of our Saviour on their ſide: The <hi>other</hi> about the adminiſtration of this Sacrament to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in both kinds; in which we are ſure that we have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our Saviour's Inſtitution on our ſide; and that ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Adverſaries themſelves do not deny it.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe I ſhall now treat, and endeavour to ſhew againſt the Church of <hi>Rome, That in this Sacrament there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change made of the Elements of Bread and Wine into the natural Body and Bloud of Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>Body</hi> which was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and ſuffered upon the Croſs; for ſo they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that hard word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I engage in this Argument, I cannot but obſerve what an unreaſonable task we are put upon, by the bold confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Adverſaries, to diſpute a matter of Senſe; which is one of thoſe things about which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath long ſince pronounc'd there ought to be no diſpute.</p>
                  <p>It might well ſeem ſtrange if any man ſhould write a Book, to prove that an <hi>Egg</hi> is not an <hi>Elephant,</hi> and that a <hi>Musket-Bullet</hi> is not a <hi>Pike:</hi> It is every whit as hard a caſe, to be put to maintain by a long Diſcourſe, that what we ſee and handle and taſte to be <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Bread,</hi> and not the <hi>Body of a Man;</hi> and what we ſee and taſte to be <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Wine,</hi> and not <hi>Bloud:</hi> And if this evidence may not paſs for ſufficient without any farther proof, <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:98824:179"/> do ſee why any man, that hath confidence enough to do ſo, may not deny any thing to be what all the world ſees it is; or affirm any thing to be what all the world ſees it is not; and this without all poſſibility of being farther confuted. So that the buſineſs of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> is not a controverſie of ſcripture againſt ſcripture, or of Reaſon againſt Reaſon, but of downright Impudence againſt the plain meaning of ſcripture, and all the ſenſe and Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>It is a moſt ſelf-evident Falſhood; and there is no Doctrine or Propoſition in the world that is of it ſelf more evidently true, then <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is evidently falſe: And yet if it were poſſible to be true, it would be the moſt, ill-natur'd and pernicious truth in the World, becauſe it would ſuffer nothing elſe to be true; it is like the <hi>Roman-catholick</hi> Church, which will; needs be the whole Chriſtian Church, and will allow no other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians to be any part of it: ſo <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if it be true at all, it is all truth; for it cannot be true unleſs our ſenſes and the ſenſes of all mankind be deceived about their proper objects; and if this be true and certain, then nothing elſe can be ſo; for if we be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of what we ſee, we can be certain of nothing.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, there is a Company of men in the World ſo abandon'd and given up by God to the efficacy of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in good earneſt to believe this groſs and palpable Errour, and to impoſe the belief of it upon the Chriſtian World under no leſs penalties then of temporal death and Eternal damnation. And therefore to undeceive, if poſſible, theſe deluded ſouls, it will be neceſſary to examine the pretended grounds of ſo falſe a Doctrine, and to lay open the monſtruous abſurdity of it.</p>
                  <p>And in the handling of this Argument, I ſhall proceed in this plain method.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider the pretended grounds and reaſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I ſhall produce our <hi>Objections</hi> againſt it. And if I can ſhew that there is no tollerable ground for it, and that there are invincible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it, then every man is not only in reaſon excuſed from believing this Doctrine, but hath great cauſe to believe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, I will conſider the pretended grounds and reaſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine. Which muſt be one or more of theſe <hi>five.</hi> Either 1. The Authority of ſcripture. Or 2ly. The perpetual belief of this Doctrine in the Chriſtian Church, as an belief of of this Doctrine in the Chriſtian Church, as an evidence that they alwayes underſtood and interpreted our Saviour's words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> in this ſenſe. Or 3ly. The authority of the, preſent Church to make and declare new articles of Faith. Or 4ly The abſolute neceſſity of ſuch a change as this in the Sacrament to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:98824:180"/> the comfort and benefit of thoſe who receive this Sacrament. Or 5<hi>ly.</hi> To magnify the power of the Prieſt in being able to work ſo great a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>1. They pretend for this Doctrine the Authority of Scripture in thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now to ſhew the inſufficiency of this pretence, I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is no neceſſity of underſtanding thoſe words of our Saviour in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is a great deal of reaſon to underſtand them otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no neceſſity to underſtand thoſe words of our Saviour in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> If there be any, it muſt be from one of theſe two reaſons. Either becauſe there are no figurative expreſſions in Scripture, which I think no man ever yet ſaid; or elſe, becauſe a Sacrament admits of no figures; which would be very abſurd for any man to ſay, ſince it is of the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrament to repreſent and exhibit ſome inviſible grace and benefit by an outward ſign and figure: And eſpecially ſince it cannot be denied, but that in the inſtitution of this very Sacrament our Saviour uſeth figurative exreſſions and ſeveral words which cannot be taken ſtrictly and literally. When he gave the Cup he ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament in my Bloud, which is ſhed for you and for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Where firſt, the <hi>Cup</hi> is put for <hi>Wine</hi> contained in the Cup; or elſe if the words be literally taken, ſo as to ſignifie a ſubſtantial change, it is not of the <hi>Wine</hi> but of the <hi>Cup</hi> and that, not into the <hi>bloud of Chriſt</hi> but into the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> or <hi>new Covenant</hi> in his bloud. Beſides, that his bloud is ſaid then to be ſhed and his body to be broken, which was not till his Paſſion, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Inſtitution and firſt celebration of this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But that there is no neceſſity to underſtand our Saviour's words in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> I will take the plain conceſſion of a great number of the moſt learned Writters of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Controverſie. <note n="a" place="margin">de Euch. l. 3. c. 23.</note>

And it is very well known, that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage things are commonly ſaid to be that which they do ſignify and repreſent; and there is not in that Language a more proper and uſual way of expreſſing a thing to ſignifie ſo and ſo, then to ſay that it is ſo and ſo.

                  </p>
                  <p>And nothing is more common in all Languages then to give the name of the thing ſignified to the Sign, as the delivery of a Deed or writing under hand and Seal is call'd a conveyance or making over of ſuch an Eſtate, and it is really ſo; not the delivery of mere wax and parchment, but the conveyance of a real Eſtate; as truly and really to all effects and purpoſes of Law, as if the very material houſes and land themſelves could be and were actually delivered into my hands: In like manner the names of the things themſelves made over to us in the new Covenant of the Goſpel between God and man, are given to the Sgns or Seals of that Covenant.

                     <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> which was broken, and of his Bloud which was ſhed for us, that is, of the real benefites of his death and paſſion. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of this Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt? the bread which We break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> But ſtill it is bread, and he ſtill calls it ſo, v. 17. <hi>For we being many are one bread and one Body; for we are partakers of that one bread.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might, if they pleaſed, as well argue from hence that all Chriſtians are ſubſtantially changed firſt into Bread, and then into the natural Body of Chriſt by their participation of the Sacrament, becauſe they are ſaid thereby to be <hi>one bread</hi> and <hi>one body..</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the conſecration of the Elements ſtill calls them the <hi>bread and the Cup,</hi> in three <hi>verſes</hi> together, <hi>As often as eat this bread and drink this Cup,</hi> v. 26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> v. 27. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread and drink of that cup,</hi> v. 28.

But that which I obſerve from our Saviour's words is, that after the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Cup,</hi> and the delivering of it to his Diſciples to drink of it, he tells them that he would thenceforth drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, which he had now drank with them, till after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. From whence it is plain that it was the fruit of the Vine, real wine, which our Saviour drank of and communicated to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if we conſider that he celebrated this Sacrament before his Paſſion, it is impoſſible theſe words, ſhould be underſtood literally of the natural body and bloud of Chriſt; becauſe it was <hi>his body</hi> and <hi>his bloud ſhed</hi> which he gave to his Diſciples, which if we underſtand literally of his naturall body broken and his bloud ſhed, theſe words, <hi>this is my body which is broken, and this is my bloud which is ſhed,</hi> could not be true, becauſe this Body was then whole and unbroken, and his bloud not then ſhed, nor could it be a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> (as they affirm this Sacramen to be) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſes they will ſay that propitiation was made before Chriſt ſuffer'd: And is likewiſe impoſſible that the Diſciples ſhould underſtand theſe words literally, becauſe they not onely plainly ſaw that what he gave them was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> but they ſaw like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98824:182"/> as plainly that it was not his Body which was given, but his Body which gave that which was given; not his body <hi>broken</hi> and his bloud <hi>ſhed,</hi> becauſe they ſaw him alive at that very time and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his body whole and unpierc'd; and therefore they could not underſtand theſe words literally: If they did, can we imagine that the Diſciples, who upon all other occaſions were ſo full of queſtions and objections, ſhould make no difficulty of this matter? nor ſo much as ask our Saviour, <hi>how</hi> can theſe things be? That they ſhould not tell him, we ſee this to be Bread and that to be Wine, and we ſee thy body to be diſtinct from both; we ſee thy body not broken, and thy bloud not ſhed.</p>
                  <p>From all which it muſt needs be very evident, to any man that will impartially conſider things, how little reaſon there is to underſtand thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>this is my body,</hi> and <hi>this is my bloud,</hi> in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> nay on the contrary, that there is very great reaſon and an evident neceſſity to underſtand them otherwiſe. I proceed to ſhew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> That this Doctrine is not grounded upon the <hi>perpetual belief of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vainly pretends as an evidence that the Church did alwayes underſtand and interpret our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's words in this ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>To manifeſt the groundleſneſs of this pretence, I ſhall, 1. ſhew by plain teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſeveral Ages, that this Doctrine was not the belief of the ancient Chriſtian Church. 2.

                  <p>1. I ſhall ſhew by plain Teſtimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſeveral Ages, for above five hundred years after Chriſt, that this Doctrine was not the <hi>belief of the ancient Chriſtian Church.</hi> I deny not but that the <hi>Fathers</hi> do, and that with great reaſon, very much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the wonderfull myſtery and efficacy of this Sacrament, and frequently ſpeak of a great ſupernatural change made by the divine benediction; which we alſo readily acknowledge. They ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Elements of bread and Wine do by the divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing become to us the body and bloud of Chriſt: But they likewiſe ſay that the names of the things ſignified are given to the Signs; that the bread and Wine do ſtill remain in their proper nature and ſubſtance, and that they are turn'd into the ſubſtance of our bodies; that the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament is not his natural, body, but the ſign and figure of it; not that body which was crucified, nor that bloud which was ſhed upon the Croſs; and that it is impious to

                     <hi>Second</hi> place, give an account of the <hi>particular time and occaſion of the coming in of this Doctrine,</hi> and by what ſteps and degrees it grew up and was advanced into an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith in the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> The Doctrine of the Corporal preſence of Chriſt was firſt ſtarted
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98824:186"/> ſtarted upon occaſion of the Diſpute about the <hi>Worſhip of Images,</hi> in oppoſition whereto the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about the year DCCL did argue thus, That our Lord having left us no other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of himſelf but the Sacrament, in which the ſubſtance of bread is the image of his body, we ought to make no other image of our Lord. In anſwer to this Argument the ſecond <hi>Council of Nice</hi> in the year DCCLXXXVII did declare, that the Sacrament after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration <hi>is not the image and antitype</hi> of Chriſts body and bloud; but is <hi>properlie</hi> his body and bloud. So that the <hi>corporal Body of Chriſt in the ſacrament</hi> was firſt brought <hi>in to ſupport the ſtupid worſhip of Images:</hi> And indeed it could never have come in upon a more proper occaſion, nor have been applied to a fitter purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but take notice how well this agrees with <note n="*" place="margin">De Euchariſt. l. 1. c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> Obſervation, that <hi>none of the Ancients who wrote of Hereſies, hath put this errour</hi> (viz. of denying <hi>Tranſubſtantiation) in his catalogue; nor did any of the Ancients diſpute againſt this errour for the firſt 600 years.</hi> Which is very true, becauſe there could be no occaſion then to dipute againſt thoſe who denied <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> ſince, as I have ſhewn, this Doctrine was not in being, unleſs amongſt the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heretiques, for the firſt 600 years and more. But <note n="‡" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goes on and tells us, that the <hi>firſt who call'd in queſtion the truth of the body of the Lord in the Euchariſt were the ICONOMACHI</hi> (the oppoſers of Images) <hi>after the year</hi> DCC <hi>in the Council of Conſtantinople; for theſe ſaid there was one image of Chriſt inſtituted by himſelf,</hi> viz, <hi>the bread and wine in the Euchariſt, which repreſents the body and bloud of Chriſt: Wherefore from that time the Greek Writers often admoniſh us that the Euchariſt is not the figure or image of the body of the Lord, but his true body, as appears from the</hi> VII. <hi>Synod;</hi> which agrees moſt exactly with the account which I have given of the firſt riſe of this Doctrine, which began with the <hi>corporal preſence of Christ</hi> in the Sacrament and afterwards proceeded to <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this was the firſt occaſion of introducing this <hi>Doctrine</hi> among the <hi>Greek;,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus,</hi> firſt a <hi>Monk,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Corbey,</hi> was the firſt broacher of it in the year DCCCXVIII.</p>
                  <p>And for this, beſides the Evidence of Hiſtory, we have the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <hi>two</hi> very Eminent Perſons in the Church of <hi>Rome, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>Sirmondus,</hi> who do in effect confeſs that this <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> was the firſt who wrote to purpoſe upon this Argument. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>,</hi> I have ſhewn likewiſe that there was <hi>conſiderable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> made to this <hi>Errour</hi> at its firſt coming in. The general Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and groſs Superſtition of that Age rendered the generality of people more quiet and ſecure, and diſpoſed them to receive any thing that came under a pretence of myſtery in Religion and of greater reverence and devotion to the Sacrament, and that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any way to countenance the worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> for which at that time they were zealouſly concern'd. But notwithſtanding the ſecurity and paſſive temper of the People, the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for piety and learning in that Time made great reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I have already named <hi>Rabanus.</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who oppos'd it as an Errour lately ſprung up and which had then gained but upon ſome few perſons.

Errour, and wrote learnedly againſt it. And theſe were the eminent men for learning in that time. And becauſe Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> will not be ſatisfied unleſs there ſome ſtir and buſtle about it, <hi>Bertram</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his book tells us, that they <hi>who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral opinions talked differently about the myſtery of Chriſts bodie and bloud were divided by no ſmall Schiſm.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> Though for a more clear ſatisfactory anſwer to this pretended <hi>Demonſtration</hi> I have been contented to unty this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:98824:188"/> knot, yet I could without all theſe pains have cut it. For ſuppoſe this Doctrine had ſilently come in and without oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that we could not aſſign the particular time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of its firſt Riſe; yet if it be evident from Records of former Ages, for above 500. years together, that this was not the ancient belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Church; and plain alſo, that this Doctrine was afterwards received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though we could not tell how and when it came in, yet it would be the wildeſt and moſt extravagant thing in the world to ſet up a pretended Demonſtration of Reaſon againſt plain Experience and matter of Fact. This is juſt <hi>Zeno's</hi> Demonſtration of the impoſſibility of motion againſt <hi>Diogenes</hi> walking before his Eyes. For this is to undertake to prove that impoſſible to have been, which moſt certainly was. Juſt thus the <hi>Servants</hi> in the <hi>Parable</hi> might have demonſtrated that the <hi>Tares</hi> were <hi>Wheat,</hi> becauſe they were ſure none but good ſeed was ſown at firſt, and no man could give any account of the punctual time when any <hi>Tares</hi> were ſown, or by whom; and if an Enemy had come to do it, he muſt needs have met with great reſiſtance and oppoſition; but no ſuch reſiſtance was made, and therefore there could be no <hi>Tares</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi> but that which they call'd <hi>Tares</hi> was certainly <hi>good wheat.</hi> At the ſame rate a man might demonſtrate that <hi>our King,</hi> his <hi>Majeſty of great Britain,</hi> is not return'd into <hi>England,</hi> nor reſtor'd to his Crown; becauſe there being ſo great and powerful an Army poſſeſs'd of his Lands, and therefore oblidged by intereſt to keep him out, it was impoſſible He ſhould ever come in without a great deal of fighting and bloud ſhed: but there was no ſuch thing, therefore he is not return'd and reſtor'd to his Crown. And by the like kind of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration one might prove that the <hi>Turk</hi> did not invade <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> laſt year, and beſiege <hi>Vienna;</hi> becauſe if he had, the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> who had the greateſt Army in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would certainly have imployed it againſt him; but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> certainly knowes, no ſuch thing was done: And therefore according to his way of Demonſtration, the <hi>matter of fact,</hi> ſo commonly reported and believed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Turks Invaſion of Chriſtendom</hi> and <hi>beſieging Vienna</hi> laſt year was a perfect miſtake. But a man may demonſtrate till his head and heart ake, before he ſhall ever be able to prove that which certainly is, or was, never to have been. For of all ſorts of impoſſibles nothing is more evidently ſo, then to make that which hath been not to have been. All the reaſon in the world is too weak to cope with ſo tough and obſtinate a difficulty. And I have often wonder'd how a man of Monſieur <hi>Arnaulds</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:98824:188"/> great wit and ſharp Judgement could prevail with himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in ſo bad and baffled a cauſe; or could think to defend it with ſo <hi>wooden a Dagger</hi> as his <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt certain <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>matter of Fact:</hi> A thing, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of equal abſurdity with what he pretends to demonſtrate <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf. I proceed to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> pretended Ground of this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and that is, <hi>The Infallible Authority of the preſent Church to make and declare new Articles of Faith.</hi> And this in truth is the ground into which the moſt of the Learned Men in their Church did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and many do ſtill reſolve their belief of this Doctrine: And, as I have already ſhewn, do plainly ſay that they ſee no ſufficient reaſon, either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> for the belief of it: And that they ſhould have believed the contrary had not the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church oblidged them otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But if this Doctrine be obtruded upon the world merely by vertue of the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Council</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. or of the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. then it is plain Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Chriſtian Doctrine, and a new Article of Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the Chriſtian World. And if any Church hath this power, the Chriſtian Faith may be enlarged and changed as often as men pleaſe; and that which is no part of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Doctrine, nay, any thing though never ſo abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, may become an Article of Faith oblidging all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the belief of it, when ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall think fit to ſtamp her Authority upon it: which would make Chriſtianity a moſt uncertain and endleſs thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> pretended ground of this Doctrine is, <hi>the neceſſity of ſuch a change as this in the Sacrament to the comfort and benefit of thoſe who receive it.</hi> But there is no colour for this, if the thing be rightly conſider'd: Becauſe the comfort and benefit of the Sacrament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the bleſſing annexed to the Inſtitution. And as <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> without any ſubſtantial change made in that Element may by the Divine bleſſing accompanying the Inſtitution be effectual to the waſhing away of Sin, and Spiritual Regeneration; So there can no reaſon in the world be given why the Elements of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> may not, by the ſame Divine bleſſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying this Inſtitution, make the worthy receivers partakers of all the Spiritual comfort and benefit deſigned to us thereby, without any ſubſtantial change made in thoſe Elements, ſince our Lord hath told us, that <hi>verily the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> So that if we could do ſo odd and ſtrange a thing as to eat the very natural fleſh and drink the bloud of our Lord, I do not ſee of what greater
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98824:189"/> advantage it would be to us then what we may have by partaking of the Symbols of his body and bloud as he hath appointed <hi>in remembrance of him.</hi> For the ſpiritual efficacy of the Sacrament doth not depend upon the nature of the thing received, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we receive what our Lord appointed, and receive it with a right preparation and diſpoſition of mind, but upon the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bleſſing that goes along with it, and makes it effectual to thoſe Spiritual ends for which it was appointed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt pretended ground of this Doctrine is, <hi>to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the power of the Prieſt in being able to work ſo great a Miracle.</hi> And this with great pride and pomp is often urg'd by them as a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inſtance of the Divine Wiſdom, to find out ſo admirable a way to raiſe the power and reverence of the Prieſt; that he ſhould be able every day and as often as he pleaſes, by repeating a few words to work ſo miraculous a change, and (as they love moſt abſurdly and blaſphemouſly to ſpeak) <hi>to make God himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is to pretend to a power above that of God himſelf, for he did not, nor cannot make himſelf, nor do any thing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction, as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> evidently does in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>to make God.</hi> For to make that which already is, and to make that <hi>now</hi> which <hi>alwayes</hi> was, is not only vain and trifling if it could be done, but impoſſible becauſe it implies a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>And what if after all, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> if it were poſſible and actually wrought by the Prieſt, would yet be no Miracle? For there are two things neceſſary to a Miracle, that there be a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural effect wrought, and that this effect be evident to ſenſe. So that though a ſupernatural effect be wrought, yet if it be not evident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſenſe it is to all the ends and purpoſes of a Miracle as if it were not; and can be no teſtimony or proof of any thing, becauſe it ſelf ſtands in need of another Miracle to give teſtimony to it and to prove that it was wrought. And neither in ſcripture, nor in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Authours, nor in common uſe of ſpeech, is any thing call'd a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle but what falls under the notice of our ſenſes: A <hi>Miracle</hi> being nothing elſe but <hi>a ſupernatural effect evident to ſenſe,</hi> the great end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign whereof is to be a ſenſible proof and conviction to us of ſomething that we do not ſee.</p>
                  <p>And for want of this Condition, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> if it were true, would be no miracle. It would indeed be very <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> but for all that it would not be a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Miracle:</hi> For a Sign or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is alwayes a thing ſenſible, otherwiſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> could be no Sign. Now that ſuch a change as is pretended in <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> ſhould really be wrought, and yet there ſhould be no ſign and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, is a thing very wonderfull, but not to ſenſe; for our ſenſes perceive no change, the bread and wine in the ſacrament to all
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:98824:189"/> our ſenſes remaining juſt as they were before: And that a thing ſhould remain to all appearance juſt as it was, hath nothing at all of wonder in it: we wonder indeed when we ſee a ſtrange thing done, but no man wonders when he ſees nothing done. So that <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> if they will needs have it a Miracle, is ſuch a Miracle as any man may work that hath but the confidence to face men down that he works it, and the fortune to be believed: And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may magnify their Prieſts upon account of this Miracle, which they ſay they can work every day and every hour yet I cannot underſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he reaſon of it; for when this great work (as they call it) is done, there is nothing more appears to be done then it there were no Miracle: Now ſuch a Miracle as to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is no miracle, I ſee no reaſon why a Proteſtant Miniſter, as well as a Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>racles.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have diſpatch'd the <hi>Firſt</hi> part of my Diſcourſe, which was to conſider the pretended grounds and <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this Doctrine, and to ſhew the weakneſs and inſufficiency of them. <hi>I</hi> come in the</p>
                  <p>SECOND place, to produce our <hi>Objections</hi> againſt <note place="margin">II.</note> it. Which will be of ſo much the greater force, becauſe I have already ſhewn this Doctrine to be deſtitute of all Divine warrant and authority, &amp; of any other ſort of Ground ſufficient in reaſon to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it. So that I do not now object againſt a Doctrine which hath a fair probability of Divine Revelation on its ſide; for that would weigh down all objections which did not plainly overthrow the probability and credit of its Divine Revelation: But I object againſt a Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine by the mere will and Tyranny of men impos'd upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Chriſtians, without <hi>any</hi> evidence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and againſt all the evidence of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Objections I ſhall reduce to theſe <hi>two</hi> Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the infinite ſcandal of this Doctrine to the Chriſtian Religion. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> the monſtrous and inſupportable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The infinite ſcandal of this Doctrine to the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And that upon theſe <hi>four</hi> accounts. 1. Of the ſtupidity of this Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. 2. The real barbarouſneſs of this Sacrament and Rite of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon ſuppoſition of the truth of this Doctrine. 3. Of the cruel and bloudy conſequences of it. 4. Of the danger of Idolatry;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98824:190"/> which they are certainly guilty of, if this Doctrine be not true.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Upon account of <hi>the ſtupidity of this Doctrine. I</hi> remember that <hi>Tully,</hi> who was a man of very good ſenſe, inſtanceth in the conceit of <hi>eating God</hi> as the extremity of madneſs, and ſo ſtupid an apprehenſion as he thought no man was ever guilty of. <note n="*" place="margin">De Nat.

It is a very ſevere ſaying of <hi>Averroes</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> Philoſopher (who lived after this Doctrine was entertained among <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> and ought to make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bluſh, if ſhe can; <note n="*" place="margin">Dionyſ.

                     <hi>I have travell'd,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>over the World, and have found divers</hi> Sects; <hi>but ſo ſottiſh a</hi> Sect <hi>or Law</hi> I <hi>never found, as is the</hi> Sect. <hi>of the</hi> Chriſtians; <hi>becauſe with their own teeth they devour their God whom they worſhip.</hi> It was great ſtupidity in the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſay, <hi>Come let us make us Gods;</hi> but it was civilly ſaid of them, <hi>Let us make Gods that may go before us,</hi> in compariſon of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſay, <hi>Let us make a God that we may eat him.</hi> So that upon the whole matter I cannot but wonder that they ſhould chuſe thus to expoſe Faith to the contempt of all that are endued with Reaſon. And to ſpeak the plain truth, the Chriſtian Religion was never ſo horribly expoſed to the ſcorn of Atheiſts and Infidels, as it hath been by this moſt abſurd and ſenſeleſs Doctrine.

                  <p n="2">2. It is very ſcandalous likewiſe upon account of the real <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs</hi> of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion, upon ſuppoſition of the truth of this Doctrine. Literally to <hi>eat the fleſh of the Son of man and to drink his bloud,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> as I have ſhewed before, declares to be a great <hi>Impiety.</hi> And the impiety and barbarouſneſs of the thing is not in truth extenuated, but only the appearance of it,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:98824:190"/> by its being done under the <hi>ſpecies of bread and Wine:</hi> For the thing they acknowledge is really done, and they believe that they verily eat and drink the natural fleſh and bloud of Chriſt. And what can any man do more unworthily towards his Friend? How can he poſſibly uſe him more barbarouſly, then to feaſt upon his living fleſh and bloud? It is one of the greateſt wonders in the World, that it ſhould ever enter into the minds of men to put upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words, ſo eaſily capable of a more convenient ſenſe and ſo neceſſarily requiring it, a meaning ſo plainly contrary to Reaſon, and ſenſe, and even to Humanity it ſelf. Had the ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans owned any ſuch Doctrine, we ſhould have heard of it from the Adverſaries of our Religion in every page of their writings; and they would have deſired no greater advantage againſt the Chriſtians then to have been able to hit them in the teeth with their feaſting upon the natural fleſh and bloud of their Lord, and their God, and their beſt Friend. What endleſs triumphs would they have made upon this Subject? And with what confidence would they have ſet the cruelty uſed by Chriſtians in their <hi>Sacrament,</hi> againſt their God <hi>Saturn's</hi> eating his own children, and all the cruel and bloudy Rites of their Idolatry? But that no ſuch thing was then objected by the <hi>Heathens</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is to a wiſe man inſtead of a thouſand Demonſtrations that no ſuch Doctrine was then believed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is ſcandalous alſo upon account of the <hi>cruel and bloudy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of this Doctrine; ſo contrary to the plain Laws of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to one great end and deſign of this Sacrament, which is to untie chriſtians in the moſt perfect love and charity to one another: Whereas this Doctrine hath been the occaſion of the moſt barbarous and bloudy Tragedies that ever were acted in the World, For this hath been in the church <hi>Rome</hi> the great <hi>burning Article,</hi> and as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and unreaſonable as it is, more chriſtians have been murther'd for the denial of it then perhaps for all the other Articles of their Religion. And I think it may generally paſs for a true obſervation that all ſects are commonly moſt hot and ſurious for thoſe things for which there is leaſt Reaſon; for what men want of Reaſon for their opinions, they uſually ſupply and make up in Rage. And it was no more then needed to uſe this ſeverity upon this occaſion; for nothing but the cruel fear of death could in probability have driven ſo great a part of mankind into the acknowledgment of ſo unreaſonable and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Doctrine.</p>

But ſuch a change I have ſhewn to be impoſſible; or if it could be, yet they can never be certain that it is, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are alwayes in danger of Idolatry: And that they can never be certain that ſuch a change is made, is evident; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to the expreſs determination of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that depends upon the mind and <hi>intention of the Prieſt,</hi> which cannot certainly be known but by Revelation, which is not pretended in this caſe. And if they be miſtaken about this change, through the knavery of croſneſs or the Prieſt who will not <hi>make GOD</hi> but when he thinks fit, they muſt not think to excuſe themſelves from Idolatry becauſe they intended to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God and not a Creature; for ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd from Idolatry in worſhipping the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip God and not a Creature; and ſo indeed we may excuſe all the Idolatry that ever was in the world, which is nothing elſe but a miſtake of the Deity, and upon that miſtake a worſhipping of ſomething as God which is not God.</p>
                  <p>II. Beſides the infinite ſcandal of this Doctrine upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I have mentioned, <hi>the monſtruous abſurdities</hi> of it make it in ſupportable to any Religion. I am very well aſſur'd of the grounds of Religion in general, and of the Chriſtian Religion in particular; and yet I cannot ſee that the foundation of any revealed Religion, are ſtrong enough to bear the weight of ſo many and ſo great abſurdities as this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would load it withall. And to make this evident, I ſhall not inſiſt upon thoſe groſs contradictions, of the ſame Body being in ſo many ſeveral places at once; of our Saviour's giving away himſelf with his own hands to every one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and yet ſtill keeping himſelf to himſelf, and a thouſand more of the like nature: But to ſhew the abſurdity of this Doctrine I ſhall only ask theſe few Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whither any man have, or ever had greater evidence of the truth of any Divine Revelation then every man hath of the falſhood of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> Infidelity were hardly poſſible to men, if
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98824:191"/> all men had the ſame evidence for the Chriſtian Religion which they have againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that is, the clear and irreſiſtible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſenſe. He that can once be brought to contradict or deny his ſenſes, is at an end of certainty; for what can a man be certain of, if he be not certain of what he ſees? In ſome circumſtances our ſenſes may deceive us, but no Faculty deceives us ſo little and ſo ſeldom: And when our ſenſes do deceive us, even that errour is not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected without the help of our ſenſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing this Doctrine had been delivered in Scripture in the very ſame words that it is decreed in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> by what clearer evidence or ſtronger Argument could any man prove to me that ſuch words were in the Bible, then I can prove to him that bread and wine after conſecration are bread and wine ſtill? He could but appeal to my eyes to prove ſuch words to be in the Bible, and with the ſame reaſon and juſtice might I appeal to ſeveral of his ſenſes to prove to him that the bread and wine after conſecration are bread and wine ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whither it be reaſonable to imagine that God ſhould make that a part of the Chriſtian Religion which ſhakes the main external evidence and confirmation of the whole? I mean the Miracles which were wrought by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof did at firſt depend upon the certainty of ſenſe. For if the ſenſes of thoſe who ſay they ſaw them were deceived then there might be no Miracles wrought; and conſequently it may juſtly be doubted whither that kind of confirmation which God hath given to the Chriſtian Religion would be ſtrong enough to prove it, ſuppoſing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be a part of it: Becauſe every man hath as great evidence that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is falſe, as he hath that the Chriſtian Religion is true. Suppoſe then <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, it muſt have the ſame confirmation with the whole, and that is Miracles: But of all Doctrines in the world it is peculiarly incapable of being proved by a Miracle. For if a Miracle were wrought for the proof of it, the very ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which any man hath of the truth of the Miracle he hath of the falſehood of the Doctrine, that is, the clear evidence of his ſenſes. For that there is a Miracle wrought to prove <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not bread but the body of Chriſt,</hi> there is only the evidence of ſenſe; and there is the very ſame evidence to prove <hi>that what he ſees in the Sacrament is not the Body of Chriſt but bread.</hi> So that here would ariſe a new Controverſie, whither a man ſhould rather believe his ſenſes giving teſtimony againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or bearing witneſs to a Miracle wrought to confirm that Doctrine; there being the very ſame evidence againſt the truth of the Doctrine, which there is for the truth
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:98824:192"/> of the Miracle: And then the Argument for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Think it enough and too much to let them rook you of your money for pretended Pardons and counterfeit Reliques, but let not the Authority of any Prieſt or Church perſwade you out of your ſenſes. Credulity is certainly a fault as well as Infidelity: And he who ſaid, bleſſed are they <hi>that have not ſeen and yet have believed;</hi> hath no where ſaid, <hi>bleſſed are they that have ſeen and yet have not believed,</hi> much leſs, <hi>bleſſed are they that believe directly contrary to what they ſee.</hi>

                  <p>To conclude this Diſcourſe. By what hath been ſaid upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it will appear, with how little truth, and reaſon, and regard to the intereſt of our common Chriſtianity, it is ſo often ſaid by our Adverſaries, that there are as good arguments for the belief of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> as of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> When they themſelves do acknowledge with us that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is grounded u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Scriptures, and that according to the interpretation of them by the conſent of the ancient Fathers: But their Doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> I have plainly ſhewn to have no ſuch ground, and that this is acknowledged by very many learned men of their own Church. And this Doctrine of theirs being firſt plainly proved by us to be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Divine Warrant and Authority, our Objections againſt it from the manifold contradictions of it to Reaſon and ſenſe are ſo many Demonſtrations of the falſehood of it. Againſt all which they have nothing to put in the oppoſite Scale but the Infallibility of their Church, for which there is even leſs colour of proof from Scripture then for <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> it ſelf. But ſo fond are they of their own Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Errours, that rather then the Dictates of their Church, how groundleſs and abſurd ſoever, ſhould be call'd in queſtion; rather then not have their will of us in impoſing upon us what they pleaſe, they will owerthrow any Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and ſhake the very foundations of our common Religion: A clear evidence that this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Mother, ſince ſhe can be ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that Chriſtianity ſhould be deſtroyed rather then the Point in queſtion ſhould be decided againſt her.</p>

                     <hi>IDolatry</hi> is ſo great a Blot in any Church, what ever other glorious <hi>Marks</hi> it may pretend to, that it is not to be wondred, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is very angry to be charged with it, as it has alwayes been by all the <hi>Reform'd;</hi> who have given in this among many others, as a juſt and neceſſary Reaſon of their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it muſt be confeſſed to be ſo, if it be fully and clearly made good againſt it; and if it be not, it muſt be owned to be great Uncharitableneſs on the other ſide, which is no good <hi>Note</hi> of a Church neither; as grievous Slander and moſt uncharitable Calumny, which will fall eſpecially upon all the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who by their Conſent and Subſcription to its Articles and to the Doctrine of its Homilies, and to the Book of Common Prayer, do expreſly join in it. For it is not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion only of ſome particular and forward men in their Zeal and Heat againſt Popery, thus to accuſe it of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but it is the deliberate, and ſober, and downright <hi>Charge</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which no honeſt man can be a Member and Miniſter, who does not make and believe it. I might give ſeveral Inſtances to ſhew this; but ſhall only mention one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have undertaken to defend our Church in its charge of Idolatry upon the Papiſts in their <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> which is in its Declaration about Kneeling at the Sacrament after the Office of the Communion, in which are theſe remarkeable words, <hi>It is hereby declared, that no Adoration is intended, or ought to be done, either unto the ſacramental Bread and Wine there bodily received, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any corporal preſence of Chriſts natural Fleſh and Blood; for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their natural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored, for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Chriſtians.</hi> Here it moſt plainly declares its mind againſt that, which is the Ground and Foundation of their Worſhipping the Hoſt. That the Elements do not remain in their natural Subſtances after Conſecration; if they do remain, as we and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98824:194"/> all Proteſtants hold, even the <hi>Lutherians,</hi> then in Worſhipping the conſecrated Elements, they worſhip meer Creatures, and are by their own Confeſſion guilty of Idolatry, as I ſhall ſhew by and by; and if <hi>Chriſts natural Fleſh and Blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e not corporally preſent there,</hi> neither with the Subſtance, nor Signs of the Elements, then the Adoring what there is moſt be the Adoring ſome things elſe then Chriſts body; and if Bread only be there, and they adore that which is there, they muſt ſurely adore the Bread it ſelf, in the opinion of our Church, but I ſhall afterwards ſtate the Controverſie more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly between us. Our Church has here taken notice of the true Iſſue of it, and declared that to be falſe, and that it is both Unfit and Idolatrous too, to Worſhip, the Elements upon any account after Conſecration, and it continued of the ſame mind, and expreſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It recommends at the ſame time, but with great Temper and Moderation, the religious Geſture of bowing towards the Altar, both before and out of the time of Celebration of the Holy Euchariſt, and in it, and in neither <note n="a" place="margin">Ib. can. 7. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis out of the great Honour and Reſpect that we bear to the Sacrament, that we are againſt the carrying it up and down as a ſhow, and the Expoſing and Proſtituting it to ſo ſhameful an Abuſe, and ſo groſs an Idolatry. We give very great Reſpect and Reverence to all things that relate to God, and are ſet apart to his Worſhip and Service; to the Temple where God is ſaid himſelf to dwell, and to be more immediately preſent; to the Altar whereon the Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Chriſts Body and Blood are ſolemnly celebrated; to the Holy Veſſels, that are alwayes uſed in thoſe Adminiſtrations; to the Holy Bible, which is the Word of God, in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as the Sacrament is his Body, and the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in his Blood; to the Font, which is the Laver of Regeneration, wherein we put on Chriſt, as well as we eat him in the Euchariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; and if we would ſtrain things, and pick out of the Ancient and Devout Chriſtians what is ſaid of all theſe, it would go as far, and look as like to ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as what with all their care they collect and produce for adoring the Sacrament, as I ſhall afterwards make appear, in anſwer to what the <note n="a" place="margin">Jacob.

                  <p>It ſeems from that Declaration of our Church, that ſome were either ſo <hi>ſilly,</hi> or ſo <hi>ſpiteful,</hi> as to ſuppoſe that by our Kneeling at the Sacrament, we gave Worſhip to the Elements; and that learned man is willing to have it believed, that we do thereby, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternè Euchariſtiam colere c,</hi> outwardly <note place="margin">b <hi>Boil.</hi> p. 145.</note> Worſhip the Sacrament, and he blames us for not doing it inwardly in our minds, as well as outwardly with our Bodies; ſo willing are theſe men to joyn with our wildeſt Diſſenters in their unreaſonable Charges againſt our Church, &amp; uſe any crutches that may help their own weak Cauſe, or be made uſe of to ſtrike at us; but it may as well be ſaid, that the Diſſenters Worſhip their Cuſhions, or their Seats, when they kneel before them; the roof of the Church, or the crowns of their Hats, when they fix their Eyes upon them; at the ſame time they are at their Prayers upon their Knees; or that the Papiſts worſhip the Prieſt himſelf, before whom they Kneel in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:98824:195"/> or that on <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi> they adore the holy Aſhes as they call them, and on <hi>Palmſunday</hi> the holy Boughs, which they do not pretend to do, becauſe they Kneel when they are given them; as well as that we Worſhip the Euchariſt, or the Myſtical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, when we receive them Kneeling, and diſavow any ſuch thing, and declare it to <hi>be Idolatry to be abhorr'd of all faithful Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is it Idolatry to Worſhip Chriſt? Or or to Worſhip the Body of Chriſt, tho' not for it ſelf, yet for the ſake of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, to which it is alwayes hypoſtatically united? No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by no means; I know no Hereticks, tho' they denied Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, but yet were for worſhipping him; the old <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the late <hi>Socinians;</hi> but how juſtifiably, when they believe him but a meer man, or only a more excellent Creature; they, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are both concerned to defend, and to clear it, if they can of Idolatry. As to the Worſhip of the Fleſh, tho' <hi>Neſtorius</hi> could not do this according to his Principles, as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> argue againſt him; nor could the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> nor <hi>Doketai</hi> of old; yet I know none but ſome of their School-men diſpute now of Adoring the Fleſh or Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, which however it be in our minds, is never in truth abſtracted from his Divinity. But we will not at all trouble our ſelves with thoſe parts of the Science of controverſie; nor ſhall we ſtand upon any of thoſe things. Well then, why may not Chriſt and his Body be adored in the Sacrament, if they are proper Objects of Adorations. No doubt but they may be adored in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> too, and in all the Offices of the Chriſtian Religion, wherein we pray to Chriſt and Kneel before him, and exerciſe the devout acts of the Mind toward him, put our truſt and hope in him, and expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him, and devout our ſelves in all Subjection to him, and bow both our Souls and our Bodies, and give all, both internal and external Worſhip to him; this Adoration we give to Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever, and who ſits at the right hand of God the Father. And the very ſame the Papiſts give to the Sacrament, to the Hoſt, and the conſecrated Elements, the the moſt Soveraigne, and Abſolute, and higheſt: Degree of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip that is due to God, whoſe creatures thoſe Elements are; or to Chriſt himſelf, who commanded us receive them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. But it is only Chriſt, ſay they, whom we Worſhip in the Sacrament, whom we adore as being preſent there with his Body in the Hoſt, and not the Hoſt or the Sacrament it ſelf; ſo a great many of them would fain bring off the matter, or at leaſt colour and diſguiſe it; <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

That all theſe do ſo, I ſhall ſhew by ſtating the controverſie carefully and truely, which is the chiefeſt thing in this diſpute; for they love to hide their own Doctrines as much as they can; and they cunningly contrive moſt of them with a back door, to ſlip out at privately and upon occaſion.

                  <p>Thus I have taken care to give you their Doctrine, and ſtate the caſe with ſome exactneſs; tho' I am ſenſible, with too much length; but that is the way to ſhorten the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; and by this means I have cut off their common retreats and ſtopt up thoſe little lurking holes they generally run to, and in which they are wont to Earth themſelves.

If this Doctrine be true, it will in great meaſure diſcharge them from the guilt of Idolatry; for then their only fault will be their joyning the ſpecies which how thin and ghoſtly ſoever they be, yet are Creatures, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with CHRIST, as one Object of Worſhip; and unleſs they alter their Doctrine on this point, from what it is now, I ſee not how they can juſtifie their worſhipping with <hi>Latreia,</hi> or the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due only to God, not only the adorable ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, but the very Vails and Symbols under which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:98824:199"/> that to lye; and yet when they teach, as they do, the adoring of the Sacrament, they muſt adore the viſible and outward part of it, as well as the inviſible Body of CHRIST; for without the remaining Species, it would not, according to them, be a Sacrament; and they have not gone ſo far yet, I think, as to deny that there are any remaining Species, and that our ſenſes do ſo far wholly deceive us, that when we ſee ſomething, there is really nothing of a viſible Object. And the ſame Object which is <hi>viſible,</hi> is <hi>adorable</hi> too, according to them: If Chriſts Body were ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament, tho' it were lawful to adore it as there preſent; but by no means, either the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> of Bread <hi>with it;</hi> yet it is much to be doubted, whither it were a duty, or neceſſary to do ſo. It would be preſent ſo like a Prince in <hi>Incognito,</hi> that he would ſeem not to require that Honour which we ought to give him under a more publick appearance. God we know is preſent in all his Creatures, but yet we are not to Worſhip him as preſent in any of them; unleſs, where he makes a ſenſible Manifeſtation of himſelf, and appears by his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or his Glory, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the burning Buſh, and to others in like manner: and it would be very ſtrange to make the Bread in the Euchariſt a <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God, which appears without any Alteration juſt as it was before it was made ſuch; and eſpecially, to make it ſuch a continuing <hi>Shechinah</hi> as the Papiſts do, that Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in it, not only in the action and ſolemn Celebration, but <hi>extra uſum,</hi> as they ſpeak, and <hi>permanenter,</hi> even after the whole Solemnity and Uſe is over; that he ſhould continue there as a <hi>praeſens Numen,</hi> as <hi>Boileau</hi> expreſly calls it <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. All Idolatry does proceed from a miſtaken belief, and a falſe ſuppoſal of the mind, which being groſs and unreaſonable, will not at all excuſe thoſe who are guilty of it; there were never any Idolaters, but might plead the excuſe of a miſtake, and that not much more culpable and notorious, one would think, then the miſtake of thoſe who think a bit of Bread, or a wafer, is turn'd by a few words into a God. They all thought, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever blindly and fooliſhly, that whatever it was they worſhip'd, ought to be worſhip'd upon ſome account or other; that it was a true and fit Object, and that Adoration rightly belong'd to it. Idolatry, tho' it be a great ſin, and a great injury and affront to God, yet ariſes not ſo much from the malice of the will, as the blindneſs and darkneſs of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; there were hardly ever any ſuch Idolaters as maliciouſly, and deſignedly intended to affront the true God, by worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping falſe Gods or Creatures; as if a ſubject ſhould paſs by his Prince out of ill will, and of purpoſe to affront and defie him, and give the Reverence and Homage that was due to him, to a Rebel or fellow Subject ſtanding by him; but they did this, becauſe they miſtook the perſon, and thought this to be the Prince that was not, or that he was there where he was not, or that that which was there, ought to be worſhip'd for his ſake; ſtill falſly ſuppoſing that they ought to worſhip that wrong Object, which they took to be right; or in that falſe manner which they took to be true; for if a miſtake will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, it will excuſe in one as well as another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tho' they do not only think and believe that which they worſhip, to be a true Divine Object; but it really be ſo in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:98824:200"/> it ſelf, and that which they have in their Thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to worſhip, be right; yet they may ſtill be guilty of Idolatry; for ſo were the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Idolatry of the golden Calf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they intended not to throw off the worſhip of the true GOD, <hi>the God of Iſrael, who brought them out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I would only ask, if a perſons having a right Object in his mind, in his thoughts and purpoſes to adore, which T. G. <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>catholiks no Idolaters,</hi> p. 329. 330.</note> ſo often pretends, would excuſe him from Idolatry; then ſuppoſe a perſon ſhould before conſecration, worſhip the Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prevent which they generally keep them from being ſeen; yet in the Thoughts, and Intentions, and purpoſes of his mind, deſign to worſhip CHRIST then ſuppoſed, tho' falſly, to be there, as they worſhip him afterwards; whither this would be Idolatry in him or no?

                  <p n="3">3. Whatever was the material Object of Idolatrous worſhip, it was nor worſhip'd for it ſelf, no more then the Bread or its Accidents are by the Papiſts in the Euchariſt; but as they ſay of the Hoſt, becauſe they believed that the true Object of worſhip
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98824:201"/> was really preſent in it, or in an extraordinary manner united to it <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p n="1">1. That it was not uſed or commanded by Chriſt or the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:98824:205"/> is plain from the account that all the Evangeliſts give us of Chriſts celebrating this Sacrament with his Apoſtles, where is only mention of their taking and eating the Bread, and drinking the Wine, after it was bleſſed by him, but not the leaſt tittle of their adoring it; ſo farr from it that they were not in a poſture of Adoration, which they ſhould have been in, if they had inwardly adored it, which makes this not only a Negative Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as <hi>Boileau</hi>

And thus they may find all devout Communicants in our Church behaving themſelves, during the whole ſolemnity and celebration of that bleſſed Sacrament, in which Myſtery they alwayes adore Chriſt, and that Fleſh of Chriſt which was crucified; for then as St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeak, when their minds are all the while inflamed with the moſt devout Affections, and they are performing all the inward and outward Acts of the higheſt Devotion to God and their Saviour, then they are upon their Knees, offering up moſt ardent Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings; but not to the ſacred ſymbols which are before them, or the Sacrament it ſelf as the object to which, but as the circumſtance, at and in which all this Devotion and Worſhip is performed. And there is a great deal of difference from all this in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they direct all this to the Sacrament it ſelf, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Elements, when they terminate their Worſhip upon what is before them, and direct their Intentions to that as an Object; and therefore, when ever they have this Object appear to them, they immediately fall down and worſhip it, not only in the time of the Communion, when it finds them at their Devotion, but at all other times; when they are ſtanding or walking in the ſtreets,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:98824:212"/> and are in no preſent Temper or Poſture of Devotion; yet all of a ſudden, as ſoon as they ſee the Hoſt coming by, they muſt put themſelves into one, and Adore that very Object, that appears to them.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers alwayes ſpeak of Perſons as coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and partaking of it, and worſhipping Chriſt, and the Body of Chriſt in the Celebration of thoſe Divine Myſteries; but it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter'd into their minds or thoughts, to perſwade or encourage their hearers in their moſt devout Diſcourſes, to Adore the Hoſt, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, either in, or eſpecially out of the time of that ſacred Solemnity; and tho' it be very eaſie to make a Book out of the Fathers, and to heap Authorities out of them to little purpoſe; yet, it is impoſſible to prove by all the places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of them, by <hi>T.

But if it were true, that ye did not worſhip the Bread, yet ye muſt and do own, that ye worſhip the Species of the Bread; and how ye ſhould do that without being guilty of another very groſs Abſurdity, ye do not know your ſelves; for ye muſt make them ſo united to Chriſt, as to make one <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> and ſo one Object of Worſhip, as his Humanity and God-Head are; and then according to this way of yours, Chriſt may as well be ſaid to be Impanated and United to Bread, or its Species, as ſome of you have taught <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>AMONG all the Errours of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ſhe hath made of <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> upon the ſubſtantial Doctrine of Chriſtianity; this Fable of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is one of the moſt notorious, invented on purpoſe to encreaſe the treaſury of the Church, by putting the groſſeſt abuſes upon the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary People: over whom ſhe hath got ſuch an abſolute dominion, as that ſhe can make them believe what ſhe pleaſes, and then can impoſe her additions to the word of God, as infallible decrees. How eaſily are the multitude led into by-paths, when that light of Scripture is taken away from their eyes, which God revealed on purpoſe, that by the ſearch thereof they might find Eternal Life? For the Scriptures are the moſt full and complete ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of God's Laws, the moſt ſufficient and certain means of Man's Salvation: I cannot then but wonder how it came to paſs, that this middle ſtate, called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> hanging thus between, Heaven and Hell, was not known to the Pen-men of God's word or if it were known, that they ſhould either be ſo envious of the Churches happineſs, or ſo forgetfull of the work they took in hand, which was to write the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, as not ſo much as one of them ſhould give us notice of this place. But this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with many others, was introduced when the World was in the dark; for in the ninth and tenth Centuries, ſuch a General ignorance and ſtupidity had ſeized the minds of Men, that ſcarce any one knew what the Doctrine of Chriſt was: when the World was thus ſtupid and Superſtitious, Men were inclined to believe ſtrange things: upon this fair opportunity, ſome cunning Men drew the ſimple People into the belief of the moſt abſurd Doctrines, under the notion of being great and profound Myſteries;
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:98824:217"/> the gallantry of Faith, they imagined, was mightily ſhewn, in ſwallowing down-right Contradictions: when this breach was once made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon the minds of Men, then any errour might enter, though as ſenſeleſs and ridiculous as <hi>Purgatory</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Which Opinion I will firſt ſhew to have no foundation in the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for what reaſon it was introduced.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what we are to believe in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I ſhall conclude with ſome reflections upon the Authours of this, and other new-invented Doctrines in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt I am to prove, that this opinion hath no foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves are ſenſible enough of this; therefore they put all the falſe <hi>gloſſes</hi> they can upon it, ſo that the People may diſcern nothing in the Scripture it ſelf, though it be as clear as the Sun: For by this craft they have their living, as <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> and his <hi>Crafts. men</hi> had heretofore. But let them fairely and honeſtly lay open the Books of God to every one's eye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any unreaſonable interpretations, or ſpurious additions made to it; and I doubt not, but the vanity of aſſerting <hi>Purgatory</hi> will ſoon appear.</p>
                  <p>Now in Scripture there are matters of a different nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Ancient Records; the Hiſtory of former Times: and theſe things were far better known, then they are now at this diſtance of time.</p>

We are infinitely beholding to the goodneſs and mercy of God, who hath appointed his only begotten Son to be our Surety, and to deliver us out of this Priſon; how juſtly then may the Saviour of the World be angry with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for pretending to caſt ſimple people into I know not what Priſon, and to torture them with painted Fires, in ſpight of that Redemption which he hath made for the whole World?</p>
                  <p>V. The Fifth place is that of <hi>Mat. 5. 22. Whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment, and whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Brother, Raca, ſhall be in danger of the Council: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou Fool, ſhalt be in danger of Hell Fire.</hi> The laſt onely of theſe ſins, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obſerves, ſhall be puniſhed with Hell Fire; conſequently after this life, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of leſſer ſins will be in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But this is no true infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; becauſe after this life, there will be no diſtinction of Courts of Juſtice, as there was among the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time; then all Judicature ſhall appertain to Chriſts and his Apoſtles: therefore this Text cannot be rightly underſtood without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the words before and after it. Now our Saviour in this Chapter was about to interpret the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> thought they had fulfilled, when they had not tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Grammatical ſenſe thereof; this made them believe that the Sixth Commandment was not broken, but by killing a Man; nor the Seventh, but actually committing Adultery or Fornication: Whereas our Saviour forbids the inward Anger of a Man againſt his Brother without a cauſe, the puniſhment whereof at the Day of Judgement ſhall be Hell Fire, How <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:98824:219"/> then ſhould be maintained from theſe words, I cannot imagine, unleſs the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> can make it out, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> had divers Temporal Courts of Juſtice, ſo God Almighty will have three diſtinct Courts of Juſtice hereafter, and will inflict different puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Sin.</p>
                  <p>VI. The Sixth place is <hi>Luk: 16. 9. Make ye friends of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Mammon, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations;</hi> Invocation of Saints, the Papiſts ſay may be proved from this Text, but I cannot ſee upon what grounds. We are adviſed to make the Poor our Friends by Charity, and by giving them ſome of our Riches, that we may have in this life the benefit of their Prayers, and thereby make God himſelf our Debtour; for he <hi>that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to the Lord.</hi>

For this Preaching was not performed by an immediate act of the Son of God, as if he perſonally had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on Earth, and actually Preached to the Old World; but he did it by the miniſtry of a Prophet: For to doe any thing by another, that is not able to perform it without him, as much demonſtrates the exiſtence of the principal cauſe, as if he did it of himſelf without any interveening inſtrument. But if <hi>purgatory</hi> be intended in theſe words, we muſt be mightily miſtaken in our conceptions about a future ſtate; then the dayes that follow after Death do afford opportunities of obtaining a better Life; then may Men riſe from a life of torments to a life of joy: whereas the Angels had one Inſtant, either to ſtand or fall eternally; what that inſtant was to them, that this Life is to us; for after death immediately follows Judgment; the Soul at its departure from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, knows it's doom, and what it muſt truſt to for ever. The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men labour all they can to deſtroy the true Belief of Chriſtians in this matter, and have the face to propoſe it as a matter of Faith, that Chriſt delivered the Souls of the Saints from the very ſuburbs of Hell, which they call <hi>Limbus of the Fathers.</hi> It is pity but the wits of theſe Men had been better imployed, then in building ſuch Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the Air, or in filling Mens thoughts, with imaginary Ideas of ſtrange places in the other World, that have no foundation in Scripture; which is our ſureſt guide againſt all ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal wandrings, opens our eyes to perceive the reality of things,

If we can aſſent to what the Papiſts ſay, they have paved a large Cauſ-way over this wide Gulf, and have opened a very eaſie paſſage from a life of torments to that of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs. For by vertue of ſome prayers, oblations and indulgences, they have made the way broad to Heaven, and narrow to Hell; a Man that hath Money in his pocket cannot be damned, and a Camel may aſſoon paſs through the eye of a nedle, as a poor man be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But granting that the written word of God hath nothing of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in it, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will tell you, that Tradition will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them in the belief thereof: which word, <hi>Tradition</hi> they are wont to alledge to give a colour to moſt of their preſent innovations.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the ſecond place I am to ſhew how they are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this caſe of Tradition alſo, and to declare for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Fiction of Purgatory was firſt ſet on foot. The Traditions we receive as good and authentick, are the Doctrines which we now read in the holy Scriptures; but I have proved <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be none of theſe: Therefore thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion muſt mean ſome other Tradition, that is not to be found written in the word of God. But here we ought to obſerve, that the Scripture in this caſe, aſwell as in all others, is the only rule of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:98824:220"/> Faith; therefore <hi>Traditions, Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> are onely to be uſed as helps to underſtand the Scripture better, but not to be entertained as any rule of Faith; in which caſe we are bound to be of the Apoſtle's mind. <hi>If I, or an Angel from Heaven preach any other doctrine then that which we have delivered, let him be accurſed.</hi> For this reaſon we cannot receive thoſe Doctrines for truth, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſſes upon our Belief upon the account of Tradition: Eſpecially when we conſider with what ſtrategems of force and fraud this Church hath laboured to keep the People in ignorance for the ſake of her New Doctrines, that they may be ſwallowed the more glibly; Which is an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to enſlave Mankind, by diſabling them either to ſee or know what ſhe is a doing: Whereas if we would keep up the honour and priviledge of Humane nature; if we would preſerve our Bibles from being ſequeſtred into Huckſters hands; if we have any regard to God's pure and undefiled Religion, we muſt reſolve againſt the Novelties of Popery. For in the true Religion, there is nothing which the reaſon of Mankind can challenge; wherein the judgments of Men may not have ſo good an account as to receive full and ample ſatisfaction. And to ſpeak the truth I do not underſtand that there is any Religion farther then that which is owned among Proteſtants: what more is to be found among the Papiſts, is accommodated to ſerve ſome by-ends and purpoſes. For this reaſons, a great Abbot in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was wont to ſay, that he did greatly ſuſpect his Religion muſt needs fail, being not built upon ſo firm a Rock as was ſuppoſed; becauſe there was ſo little Ground for many Tenents of it in the word of God: I may add, that there is as little in the principals of God's Creation, or in that which we call Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion.</p>
                  <p>If this be ſo, <hi>I</hi> wonder with what face they can ſtill ſtand up for <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or imagine ſuch a ſtate, in which the Souls of Men are for a time ſhut up, untill they are ſet at liberty by the Prayers of the Living, or a Pope's Indulgence: but to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this unpardonable abuſe of the Chriſtian Religion, they tell us, that ſome Chriſtians in Old Time did make uſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Commemorations for thoſe who died in the true Faith of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Now the queſtion is, whither the <hi>Supplicants,</hi> that uſed this kind of Devotion, intended by theſe means to obtain a pardon for the Criminals that were condemned to this Priſon. The right underſtanding of this cuſtome will put an end to the Controverſie; and who can better inform us of their meaning then they themſelves, or thoſe that lived in the ſame Age with them; amongſt whom may be reckoned <hi>Dionyſius</hi>

But the Primitive Church know but two places of entertainment for the Dead after this Life, Heaven, and Hell; the firſt for good, the latter for evil Men; one for the Beliver, the other for the Infidel; Heaven is for him whoſe <hi>ſins are remitted,</hi> and Hell is for him whoſe <hi>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For as ſoon as the World was put into a great Fright about <hi>purgatory,</hi> then came in the ſale of Indulgences; which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Prieſts put off for ſecurities againſt the vain fears and dangers to be met withall in this place: This indeed is a Doctrine of good advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but moſt diſgracefull to the Chriſtian Religion; for what can be more ſo, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud Chriſt himſelf of the Title and Merit which he ever had, of being The only Redeemer of Mankind; as if he had not by his Sacrifice on the Croſs fully ſatisfied the Divine Juſtice, but that this great work was to be done by <hi>Pope's Bulls, Indulgence</hi> and <hi>Maſſes?</hi> But for all this we will oblidge our ſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſeſſours, if they can from Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or untainted Tradition ſhew us where God hath told Men, tha
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:98824:221"/> he is pleaſed with theſe things, and is reſolved to accept of them inſtead of a good and Chriſtian Life. For this was alwayes the Faith of the Primitive Church, that the ſtate and condition of a Man into which he paſſeth after Death ſhall never be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this I could prove out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr ad Orthodoxos,</hi> and out of St. <hi>Cyprian ad Demetrianum;</hi> but my Deſign is not, to fill this brief Diſcourſe with Quotations, and indeed there is no neceſſity for it, becauſe we have Scripture, the common ſenſe of Mankind, and the Faith of the beſt and pureſt Ages on our ſide.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the third place, I will ſhew what our Belief ought to be in this matter. We all know very well, that we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Scripture directs, and herein we are taught that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell are fixed for <hi>the two Eternal States</hi> of good and bad Men; who if after this Life they had any hopes of gaining the firſt, or eſcaping the latter by the Prayers or the Gifts of their ſurviving Friends, this expectation would in a great meaſure fruſtrate the intent of Chriſt's coming into the World, which was to teach Men how in <hi>this preſent Life</hi> they muſt work out their Salvation, how through patient continuance in well doing they muſt here be brought to goodneſs and real vertue; the practice whereof in all probability woud be quite laid aſide, if they ſhould depend upon ſuch fooliſh hopes, as theſe are. If we do but conſider the reaſon of theſe promiſes and threatnings, which GOD makes uſe of in Scripture to reclaim the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, we muſt be convinced, that there can be no ſuch place as <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For promiſes and threatnings are made uſe of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to work upon our hopes and fears, two the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing paſſions of the mind; we have the promiſe of preſent aſſiſtance to encourage our endeavours in a vertuous life, and to make this work the more eaſie, we have the aſſurance of a future reward. Whereas Religion would be thought in its ſtricteſt duties to be a burthen too heavy for Men to bear, if ſo be they ſhould once entertain the hopes of getting Heaven by <hi>ſuch cheap and eaſie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſcribes: Perſons that are her Proſelytes will not be wrought upon by that fear, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per product of the threatnings of the Goſpel, when the moſt dreadfull condition, that can be feared hereafter may be avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they think, by the <hi>charms of Maſſes;</hi> or <hi>ſome legacy to the Church.</hi> But theſe are <hi>cunningly diviſed Fables,</hi> which the Scripture warns us of; which Goſpel, becauſe of the terrours of it, is ſaid to be <hi>the mighty power of God to ſalvation:</hi> For great fear makes difficulties eaſie, it awakens all our powers, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all our motions, it turns our feet into wings, and enables Men to doe many things with eaſe, which without ſo ſtrong a motive they
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:98824:222"/> would never be perſwaded to attempt. The lively apprehenſion of the danger of their Souls, and the ſad iſſues of a wicked life is enough to make the moſt profane Man ſtop his courſe, it will incite him to ſummon all his powers to reſiſt ſo great a miſchief as will undoe him for ever. Beſides the Commands of God are exceedingly ſweetned by Love, by all the imaginale obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Kindneſs; when we have conſidered how undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have demeaned our ſelves towards him who is the great Benefactor of our life, who hath recovered us from eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with how much long ſuffering he hath expected to our amendment; what means he hath uſed to reconcile us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by ſending his onely Son to dye, that we might live, to be made a Spectacle of miſery and contempt, that he might bring us to happineſs and glory: he onely hath delivered us from Wrath and the Tormentour, when we lay open to the revenge of God's Juſtice. If we have any ſenſe of benefits, we cannot chuſe but love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him who hath done ſo much to oblidge us; for his whole Religion preſents ſuch arguments and conſiderations to us as are apt to ſtir up all thoſe paſſions in our hearts, which are the great inſtruments to action; theſe are our hope, fear and love. But the workings of theſe paſſions muſt needs be ſtifled by a <hi>lazy, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious devotion,</hi> I mean that devotion of the Papiſts which is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a belief of ſuch dreams as Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore that are Proteſtants conſider, that the main work we are to doe in the time of this life, is to prepare for our immortal ſtate; for the time of this life is the day of exerciſe, wherein we are to make tryal of our ſtrength, and with all our powers to labour for Heaven, the way to which place ly right before us, it is ſtrait and narrow, ſo that we muſt uſe ſome care and diligence, that we turn not to the right, nor to the left: the wayes of Popery are like the paths of ſin, crooked and full of windings through <hi>Cells</hi> and <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> in long <hi>Proceſſions</hi> and <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> wherewith Men are rather perplexed then their minds are improved, or their lives made better: by the practice of theſe things they are brought off from the true meaning of the Chriſtian Religion, and learn at laſt to content themſelves with pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhews inſtead of <hi>living righteouſly, godly and ſoberly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World:</hi> For how can the ends of Religion be accompliſhed by this courſe, when in the place of juſtice, honeſty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſimple and plain vertues, the People are brought up to ſhew ſo many <hi>tricks,</hi> and to act over ſo many <hi>mimical poſtures</hi> of Worſhip?</p>
                  <p>But thanks be to God, <hi>we have not ſo learned Chriſt:</hi> we came not into the World to be idle Spectatours therein, to be ſlothfull

And as we are not to neglect our duty upon which the ſaving of our Souls depends, in expectation, that after this life is ended we may get <hi>out of Purgatory</hi> into Heaven; ſo we muſt not miſtake our time of doing our duty, but begin it as ſoon as we come to the uſe of our reaſon and underſtanding, that aſſoon as our rationall <hi>powers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to move, Religion alſo may ſhew it ſelf at the ſame time with all the brightneſs and majeſty of truth and vertue. Therefore Men do mightily abuſe themſelves when they are led aſide by erroneous opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their future ſtate, and ſo loſe the happy occaſion of advancing their true intereſt: this they do, who put off their living well to the laſt, who defer their Repentance with groundleſs hopes of having the ſame good ſucceſs as the Penitent Thief had, or who neglect all thoſe good means that would make them ſound and good Chriſtians, out of a falſe perſwaſion, that their ſufferings hereafter will be but Temporary, and then they ſhall be as happy as the beſt Men are. Some Philoſophicall Perſons are miſtaken in this matter; for they will tell you, that they would rather chuſe not to be at all, then be placed in ſuch a condition of Life as that they ſhall be in danger of everlaſting puniſhment if they difobey the Laws of God. Surely this cannot be the deſire of a good or a wiſe Man, as if a Man had better chuſe to live in the Woods in a wilde ſtate of confuſion and anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, then be ſubject to the Laws of a Juſt and Mercifull Ruler, under whom he may lead an happy and quiet life, meerly becauſe he ſhall be puniſhed if he do amiſs We are beholding to the infinite bounty and goodnes of God, for that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all a Being; and when we were made, it was abfolutly neceſſary that we ſhould carefully obſerve and keep the Laws of Almighty God: but ſuch is the degeneracy of Mankind, that they would never doe this, unleſs there were ſevere penalties to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the violation of them; which penalties are eternal upon impenitent Sinners for this reaſon among others, becauſe the goodneſs and mercy of God is eminently ſhewn towards Men both in threatning and inflicting theſe puniſhments; for hereby they may behold his ſeverity againſt fin, and ſo break off the practices of it, that they may eſcape the puniſhments of the future ſtate, which are inflicted becauſe Men have been unreclaimable either by the mercies or ſeverities of God towards them in this life.

Now there cannot be ſo great a certainty in Faith as in ſcience, the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> for inſtance; becauſe Faith is more lyable to doubting then ſcience is: If any Man perceives the ſtrength and force of a <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Demonſtration,</hi> he cannot in the mean while doubt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: but now a true Believer doth often ſtrugle with doubting and unbelief, wherewith his Faith is aſſaulted, and yet it ceaſeth not to be true Faith. We muſt confeſs that the mind doth leſs clearly perceive this to be <hi>the word of God,</hi> then it doth thoſe things which are ſelf-evident, and the concluſions logically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from: There is no reaſon therefore that any one ſhould fear to acknowledge that aſſent to be alſo leſs certain:
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:98824:224"/> notwithſtanding it follows not upon this account that Faith is un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>certain, for That, which ariſes not to the certainty of the ſcience, is not therefore uncertain; for although that certainty, which is called Moral, be of an inferiour degree to Demonſtration, yet it is a true certainty, leaves the mind ſatisfied and free from doubt. But how can a Man be ſaid to have a certainty greater then that of ſcience, when he hath not that certainty of evidence from the Arguments upon which the matter is grounded? It may be anſwered, that no Man can deny but there may be juſt cauſe why a Man may adhere to the objects of his Faith more ſtrongly then the Arguments brought for the truth thereof do require: For when a Man is ſufficiently perſwaded by due rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments, that what is propounded to him for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, is indeed ſuch; this Man, if he duly attends and ſeriouſly conſiders, that it is God, who ſpeaks, he will be wholly bent to yield obedience thereunto, he will entertain the word of God with the higheſt veneration, he will cloſely adhere to it, and he will be fully reſolved to ſuffer and renounce all things rather then withdraw his aſſent from thoſe matters of Faith which are contained in it, and confirmed by it. From thence there ariſes in his mind a greater, or at leaſt a more effectual adherence to the Articles of his Faith, then there is in Science: for the mind ſo affected and diſpoſed doth more affectionately embrace, and more firmly hold that word of God, then any thing elſe, by what light ſoever it be propounded, or by whatever ſtrength of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration it be confirmed: Neither is there any knowledge which he doth ſo carefuly retain, nor is there any aſſent which he will ſuffer ſo hardly or with ſuch difficulty to be forced from him: which firmneſs of Faith and ſtrong adherence of mind to the objects of it, is not produced by the evidence thereof, but by the great weight and moment of it; for the mind being enlightened by the holy Spirit, underſtands that any other ſpeculative ſcientifical Doctrine doth little or nothing conduce to a happy and bleſſed life; but that on <hi>This</hi> our everlaſting happineſs doth depend, and that we cannot reject <hi>This</hi> without certain Ruine.

                  <p>Firſt, They may be charged for impoſing upon our belief things contrary to reaſon, ſelf-inconſiſtent and incongruous: of this I will give but one inſtance, which is their aſſerting, that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament is changed into the <hi>real and ſubſtantial Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> For this is the hardeſt thing that ever was put upon men in any Religion; becauſe they cannot admit it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their reaſon be laid aſide, as no competent Judge in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; unleſs alſo they give the lye to the report of their ſenſes. And if they do this, how ſhall we think, that GOD made our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties true? which if he did not do, we are abſolutely diſcharged from all duty to him, becauſe we have no faculty that can reſolve us, that <hi>this is of GOD:</hi> for if our reaſon muſt not be truſted, we muſt ceaſe to be Men: if our ſenſes are not to be believed, the chiefeſt proof of Chriſtians falls to the ground; which was the ſight of thoſe, <hi>who ſaw our Saviour,</hi> after <hi>he was riſen from the Dead.</hi> Now if I may not believe the reaſon of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that any thing is <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that:</hi> therefore <hi>I</hi> ſay, that this Doctrine is a groſs invention of Men, contrary <hi>both to reaſon and ſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Truths they do acknowledge, are made void by ſubtile diſtinctions, or equivocations: as for example, their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Probability and of directing the intention; if a Man can find any Doctour among them, that held ſuch an opinion, it makes that Doctrine probable: and there is nothing ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the rules of Vertue and Conſcience, but what ſome <hi>Romiſh Caſuiſtical</hi> Doctour hath reſolved to be good and practicable: juſt as <hi>Tully</hi> ſayes, there is nothing ſo abſurd or ridiculous, which ſome <hi>Philoſopher</hi> or other hath not maintained and aſſerted. So by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their intention, they may declare that which is falſe, and deny that which is true, becauſe they intend the credit of their Church and Religion; this mere intention ſhall excuſe them from the guilt of downright falſhood and lying. They are ſo well practiſed in equivocations, that you cannot confide in any words they ſpeak; they are ſo ambiguous, and of ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaning: in their evaſions their Speech ſhall bear a double ſenſe whereas no Man ought to uſe wit and parts to impoſe upon another, or to make a Man believe That, which he doth not mean. For the Chriſtian Law is plain and obvious, void of all ambiguity or enſnaring ſpeeches, free from all <hi>Sophiſtications,</hi> and <hi>windings of Language,</hi> never flies to words of a dubious or uncertain ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but plainly declares the truth to Men: therefore
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:98824:225"/> theſe practices are contrary to that ſimplicity and plain hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ought to be in the converſation of every Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They ſuper-add to Religion things altogether unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be true, and diſhonorable to GOD; which will appear in theſe following particulars.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. They withhold the uſe of Scripture from the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they ſay, Knowledge of the very Oracles of God will make them contentious and diſobedient to Authority: if this be true, then the blame of all this muſt be laid upon our bleſſed Saviour, for revealing ſuch a Doctrine to the World as this is, and thereby we ſhould condemn the Apoſtles for making known ſuch a Doctrine to Men, in a Tongue they underſtand; but I ſuppoſe, the Papiſts are not willing to lay all the miſcarriages of the World upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Although Men may abuſe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:98824:226"/> the Knowledge of the Scripture, yet the abuſe of a thing that is uſefull, was never accounted a ſufficient reaſon for the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away: therefore Men are not to be hindred from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Scriptures, for fear they ſhould become proud or rebellious; for this would be, as if one ſhould put out a Man's Eyes, that he might the better follow him, or that he might not looſe his way: for there is nothing in the whole Doctrine of out bleſſed Saviour, which is unfite for any Man to know, but what is plainly deſigned to promote holineſs and the practice of a good life: the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do indeed pretend, that the unity and peace of the Church cannot be maintained, unleſs the People be kept in ignorance: then the miſchief will be, that for the end of keeping Peace and Unity in the Church, Church and Chriſtian will be both loſt; which would be, as if a Prince ſhould knock all his Subjects on the Head, to keep them quiet. 'Tis true, this would be an effectual way to procure it, but by theſe means he muſt loſe his Kingdom, and make himſelf no Prince into the bargain. 'Tis no doubt, but if Men were ignorant enough, they would be quiet; but then the conſequences of it would be, that they <hi>would ceaſe to be Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They fruſtrate the effects of real Religion by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to extraordinary Power and Priviledges; that is, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make that lawfull, which is unlawfull: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that the Pope may declare <hi>vice to be vertue,</hi> and <hi>vertue vice:</hi> by this practice they attempt to change <hi>the reaſon of things,</hi> which all Mankind agree to be unalterable. By this pretended Power they can turn <hi>attrition</hi> into <hi>contrition;</hi> that is, they can make ſuch a conſternation of mind, as fell upon <hi>Judas,</hi> when he went and hanged himſelf, to be <hi>contrition</hi> by the Prieſt's Abſolution: they can m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But they doe not: for though the ſins of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be privately and particularily forgiven at the day of Death, yet the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:98824:226"/> publick promulgation of their pardon is to come at the day of Judgment. Chriſtians then may be allowed to pray for this conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Bleſſedneſs, when <hi>the Body ſhall be reunited to the Soul:</hi> So we pray, as often as we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> or <hi>come Lord Jeſus, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>All theſe things before mentioned are not to be juſtified; but thus the Papiſts have endeavoured to ſpoil the beſt Religion that ever was made known unto Men.

                  <p>If therefore we have any love of our Religion, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the happineſs of our Church and Nation; if we have any deſire to hold the freedom of our Conſciences, or any care for the eternal ſafety of our Souls, it behoves us to beware of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe ſucceſs we muſt expect to forfeit all theſe intereſts; every one of which ought to be dearer to us, then our <hi>lives.</hi>

                  <p>THE Zealots of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are wont to Glory of the ſingular advantages, in the Communion of that Church, eſpecially in reſpect of the greater means and helps of Spiritual comfort, which they pretend are to be had there, above and beyond what are to be found amongſt other Societies of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Which one thing, if it could be as ſubſtantially made out, as it is confidently aſſerted, could not fail to ſway very much with all Wiſe men, and would undoubtedly prevail with all devout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (who were made acquainted with the ſecret) to go over to them. But if contrariwiſe it appear upon ſearch, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of this kind are falſe and groundleſs, and that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Adminiſtring conſolation, which are peculiar to that Church, are as well unſafe and deceitful, as ſingular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary: Then the ſame Prudence and ſincerity, will oblige a man to ſuſpect that Communion, inſtead of becoming a proſelyte to it, and to looke upon the aforeſaid boaſtings as the effect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of deſigned impoſture, or at the leaſt of Ignorance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other things that Church highly values it ſelf upon the, Sacrament of Penance (as they call it) and as deeply blames and condemns the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other Reformed Churches, for their defect in, and neglect of ſo important and comfortable an Office. And under that ſpecious pretext, her Emiſſaries (who are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To that purpoſe, they will not only harangue them with fine ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the eaſe and benefit of it, as of an Ancient and uſeſull Rite, but will alſo Preach to them the neceſſity of it, as of Divine Inſtitution, and that it is as important (in its kind) as Baptiſm or the Lords Supper. For that Confeſſion to a Prieſt, and his Abſolution thereupon obtained, is the only means appointed by God for the procuring of Pardon of all mortal ſins commited after Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>As for Original ſin, or whatſoever <note place="margin">

                  <p>This Sacrament of Penance therefore is called by them, <hi>Secunda Tabula poſt naufragium,</hi> the peculiar refuge of a lapſed Chriſtian, the only Sanctuary of a guilty Conſcience, the ſole means of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a perſon to Peace of Conſcience, the Favour of God, and the hopes of Heaven. And withall, this method is held to be ſo Soveraign and Effectual a remedy, that it cures <hi>toties, quoties;</hi> and whatever a mans miſcarriages have been, and how often ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever repeated, if he do but as often reſort to it, he ſhall return as pure and clean as when he firſt came from the Font.</p>
                  <p>This ready and eaſie way (ſay they) hath God allowed men, of quiting all ſcores with himſelf, in the uſe of which they may have perfect peace in their Conſciences, and may think of the day of Judgment without horror, having their Caſe decided before hand by Gods deputy the Prieſt, and their Pardon ready to produce, and plead at the Tribunal of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>What a mighty defect is it therefore in the Proteſtant Churches, who wanting this Sacrament, want the principal miniſtry of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? And who would not joyn himſelf to the Society of that Church, where this great Caſe is ſo abundantly provided for? For if all this be true, he muſt be extreamly fool-hardy and deſerve
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:98824:231"/> to periſh, who will not be of that Communion from whence the way to Heaven is ſo very eaſie and obvious, no wonder therefore I ſay, if not only the looſe and vicious are fond of this Communion where they may ſin and confeſs, and confeſs and ſin again without any great danger, bnt it would be ſtrange if the more Vertuous and Prudent alſo, did not out of more caution think it became them to comply with his expedient. For as much as there is no man who underſtands himſelf, but muſt be conſcious of having committed ſins ſince his Baptiſm, and then for fear ſome of them ſhould prove to be of a mortal nature, it will be his ſafeſt courſe to betake himſelf to this refuge, and conſequently he will eaſily be drawn to that Church, where the only remedy of his diſeaſe is to be had.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt of it is, theſe things are ſooner ſaid then proved, and more eaſily phanſied by ſilly People, then believed by thoſe of diſcretion. And therefore there may be no culpable defect in the reformed Churches, that they truſt not to this remedy in ſo great a Caſe. And as for the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, though ſhe hath no fondneſs for Mountebank Medicines, as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to be ſeldom ſucceſsful; yet ſhe is not wanting in her care, and compaſſion to the Souls of thoſe under her guidance, but expreſſeth as much tenderneſs of their peace and comfort, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can pretend to. Indeed ſhe hath not ſet up a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors Chair in every Pariſh, nor much leſs placed the Prieſt in the Seat of God Almighty, as thinking it ſafer, at leaſt in ordinary Caſes, to remit men to the Text of the written word of God, and to the publick Miniſtry thereof, for reſolution of Conſcience, then to the ſecret Oracle of a Prieſt in a corner, and adviſes them rather to obſerve what God himſelf declares of the nature and guilt of ſin, the aggravations or abatements of it, and the terms and conditions of Pardon, then what a Prieſt pronounces. But however this courſe doth not pleaſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for reaſons beſt known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which if we may gueſs at, the main ſeems to be this, they do not think it fit to let men be their own carvers, but lead them like Children by the hand; my meaning is, they keep People as much in ignorance of the Holy Scripture as they can, locking that up from them in an unknown Tongue; now if they may not be truſted with thoſe Sacred Records, ſo as to inform themſelves of the terms of the New Covenant, the conditions of the Pardon of ſin, and Salvation, it is then but reaſonable that the Prieſt ſhould Judge for them, and that they await their doom from his Mouth. Yet I do not ſee why in a Proteſtant Church, where the whole Religion is in the Mother Tongue, the Old, and eſpecially the New Teſtament conſtantly, and conſcientiouſly expounded and the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:98824:231"/> People allowed to ſearch the Scriptures and <hi>to ſee whither things be ſo or no,</hi> I ſee not, I ſay, Why in ſuch a caſe the Prieſt may not in great meaſure be excuſed the trouble of attending ſecret Confeſſions, without danger to the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this, there is a conſtant uſe of Confeſſion and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution too, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in every dayes Service; which though they be both in general terms, as they ought to be in publick Worſhip, yet every Penitent can both from his own conſcience ſupply the generality of the confeſſion by a remorſeful reflection upon his own particular ſins, as well as if he did it at the knees of a Prieſt; and alſo by an Act of Faith can apply the general Sentence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to his own Soul, with as good and comfortable effects, as if it had been ſpecially pronounced by his Confeſſor.</p>
                  <p>But this publick confeſſion doth not pleaſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they know a Reaſon for their diſlike; namely, becauſe this doth not conciliate ſo great a Veneration to the Prieſt-hood, as when all men are brought to kneel to them for Salvation: Neither doth this way make them to pry into the ſecret thoughts of Men, as Auricular confeſſion doth, wherein the Prieſt is not only made a Judge of mens eſtate, but a Spy upon their behaviour, and is capable of becoming an Intelligencer to his Superiours of all the Deſigns, Intereſts, and even conſtitutions of the People.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the church of <hi>England</hi> allows of private confeſſions alſo, as particularly in the Viſitation of the ſick, (which office extends alſo to them that are troubled in Mind or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as well as to the afflicted in Body) where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is directed to examine particularly the ſtate of the Decum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents ſoul, to ſearch and romage his conſcience, to try his Faith, his Repentance, his Charity, nay, to move him to make a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial confeſſion of his ſins, and afterwards to abſolve him upon juſt grounds.</p>
                  <p>Nay farther yet, if (beſides the caſe of ſickneſs) any Man ſhall either out of perplexity of Mind, ſcrupuloſity or remorſe of conſcience, or any other devout conſideration, think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to apply himſelf to a Prieſt of the church of <hi>England</hi> for advice, eaſe, or relief, he hath incouragement and direction ſo to do in the firſt Exhortation to the Holy communion, and may be ſure to find thoſe who will tenderly, and faithfully, as well as ſecretly adminiſter to his neceſſities. So that I ſee not what defect or omiſſion can be objected to this church in all this Affair, or what Temptation any Man can have upon this account to go from us to the church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>For ſo the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> determines, <hi>Seſſ. 4. canon 1. Si quis dixerit in Eccleſia catholica poenitentiam non eſſe vere &amp; proprie Sacramentum pro fidelibus, quoties poſt Baptiſmum in peccata laben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ipſi Deo reconciliandis a Domino noſtro inſtitutum, Anathema ſit;</hi> i. e. Let him be accurſed, who ſhall affirm that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is not truly and properly a Sacrament inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Univerſal Church, by our Lord Chriſt himſelf, for the reconciling thoſe Chriſtians to the Divine Majeſty, who have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into Sin after their Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And in the Doctrinal part of that Decree they teach and aſſert more particularly; Firſt, That our Saviour inſtituted this Sacrament expreſly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22.</p>
                  <p>2. That this Sacrament conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Matter and the Form; the matter <note place="margin">Seſſ, 14. Cap. 2.</note> of the Sacrament (or <hi>quaſi materia,</hi> as they cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpeak) is the act or acts of the Penitent, namely, contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confeſſion, and Satisfaction; the Form of it is the act of the Prieſt in theſe words, <hi>Abſolvote.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That therefore it is the duty of every Man <note place="margin">cap. 3.</note> who hath fallen after Baptiſm, as aforeſaid, to confeſs his ſins at leaſt once a year to a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>4. That this confeſſion is to be ſecret; for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <note place="margin">cap. 5.</note> confeſſion they ſay is neither commanded nor expedient.</p>
                  <p>5. That this confeſſion of Mortal ſin be very <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> exact and particular, together with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:98824:232"/> eſpecially ſuch as <hi>ſpeciem facti mutant,</hi> alter the kind or degree of ſin, and that it extend to the moſt ſecret ſins, even of thought, or againſt the 9th. and 10th. Commandment. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. That the Penitent thus doing, the Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt here upon pronounced is not <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> conditional or declarative only, but abſolute and judicial.</p>
                  <p>Now in oppoſition to this Doctrine and Decree of theirs, and the practice of that Church purſuant thereof, as well as in defence of the Doctrine and practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that particular, I will here endeavour to make good theſe Three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our bleſſed Lord and Saviour hath neither in his Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſuch an Auricular Confeſſion as aforeſaid, nor much leſs, ſuch a Sacrament of Penance as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppoſes in the recited Decree,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Auricular Confeſſion hath not been of conſtant and univerſal uſe in the Chriſtian Church, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend, much leſs looked upon as of Sacramental and neceſſary Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Auricular confeſſion as it is now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not only unneceſlary and burdenſome, but in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects very miſchievous to Piety, and the great ends of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>If the firſt of theſe appear to be true, then (at the worſt) the want of ſuch an Auricular confeſſion in the reformed Churches, can be but an irregularity, and no eſſential defect.</p>
                  <p>If the ſecond of theſe aſſertions be made good, then it can be no defect at all in thoſe Churches that uſe not ſuch a Rite, but a novely and impoſition on their parts who ſo ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
                  <p>But if the third be true: it will be the corruption and great fault of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to perſevere in the injunction and practice of it, and the excellency and commendation of thoſe Churches which exclude it</p>
                  <p>I begine with the firſt, that it doth not appear that our Saviour hath inſtituted ſuch an Auricular Confeſſion, of ſuch a Sacrament of Penance as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends and practiſes.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it is a Negative which I here undertake to make good, which is accounted a difficult Province, but the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath relieved us in that particular by founding the Inſtitution expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that one paſſage of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 2z. So that we ſhall not need to examine the whole Body of Scripture to diſcover what footſteps of Divine Inſtitution may be found here or there, for the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:98824:233"/> Councill wholly inſiſts and relies upon that Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> and therefore if that fail them, the whole <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Now for the clearing of this, let us lay the words before us; and they are theſe, <hi>He breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt, whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſeſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I appeal to any Man that hath Eyes in his Head, or Ears to hear, whither in this Text there be any one word of Auricular Confeſſion, or much leſs of ſuch a circumſtantiated one as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; And this is ſo manifeſt and notorious, that their own ancient Canoniſts and ſeveral of their learned Divines are aſhamed of the pretence of Divine Inſtitution founded upon this or any other paſſage of Scripture, and therefore are content to defend the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this particular, upon the account of the Authority, and general uſage of the Church; which we ſhall come to examine by and by in its due place.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I cannot chooſe but admire the mighty Faith of a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> who can believe in ſpight of his own Eyes. It ſeemed to us an unſuperable difficulty heretofore, for a Man to perſwade himſelf that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt Bread was tranſubſtantiated into Fleſh, becauſe it was againſt the expreſs Teſtimony of Senſe, yea, although for that there was the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Five figurative (but miſtaken) words to ſupport the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity; but this of the Sacrament of Penance clearly out does it, for here a Man muſt believe a thing to be, when as there is not ſo much as one word for the ground of his Faith, or the proof of the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How many Sacraments may not ſuch men have if they pleaſe? What voluminous Creeds may not they ſwallow and digeſt? What Mountains may not ſuch a wonderful Faith remove?</p>
                  <p>But let us hear what they have to ſay for themſelves, perhaps in the firſt place they will plead the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which hath peremptorily determined the ſenſe of the paſſage of the Goſpel to the purpoſe aforeſaid. Indeed that Council in the third Canon of their fourteenth Seſſion, doth damne all thoſe who deny that a Sacrament of Penance and Auricular Confeſſion is preſcribed in that Text of St. <hi>John,</hi> or who apply it to any other purpoſe. But in ſo doing, they both uſurp a Prerogative which was never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, or practiſed by any Council before them, and withal they betray a conſciouſneſs that the Text it ſelf yeilded no ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the thing which they deſigned to countenance by it; for what Councils (ever till now) brought a Text, and then impoſed an Interpretation upon it contrary to the words? And then back'd that Interpretation with an <hi>Anathema?</hi> If the Text were plain or
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:98824:233"/> could be made ſo, why was not that done? And to be ſure if that cannot be done by other means, the curſe will not do it; at leaſt to any but very obedient <hi>Roman</hi> conſciences. Beſides if this courſe be allowed, I ſee not but a Council may bring in what Religion they pleaſe, having firſt made a Noſe of Wax of the Holy Scripture, and then writhed it into what ſhape they beſt phanſy; for in ſuch a caſe, if the words of the Goſpel do not favour me, I can govern the ſenſe and if the letter be ſilent or intractable, I can help that with an Interpretation; and if I have authority or confidence enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that under the peril of <hi>Anathema,</hi> I am no longer an Interpreter or a Judge, but a Law-giver, and need not trouble my ſelf with <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> but may (if I will ſpeak plain) ſay <hi>decretum eſt,</hi> and the buſineſs is done.</p>
                  <p>But if neither the Letter of Scripture, nor the Authority of a Council will do in this caſe, then in the ſecond place they think they have at leaſt ſome colour of Reaſon to relieve them; and if they cannot find Auricular Confeſſion in the Text, yet they will by conſequence infer it thence; for they ſay although indeed it is true it is not here expreſly mentioned, yet it is certain that our Saviour in the Text before us inſtituted a Sacrament of penance and therefore Auricular Confeſſion muſt neceſſarily be implied becauſe abſolution cannot be without confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Here the Reader will obſerve that the point in Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is very much altered, for we are now fallen from the conſideration of the Divine Inſtitution of Auricular confeſſion in particular to that of a Sacrament of Penance in general, <hi>i. e.</hi> from direct proof to a <hi>ſubintelligitur.</hi> But we will follow them hither alſo, and for the clearing of this matter we will briefly conſider theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whither that can properly be ſaid to be of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and neceſſary to ſalvation, which depends on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and is proved only by an <hi>innuendo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whither it can be reaſonable to aſſert that our Saviour there inſtitutes a Sacrament of Penance, where not only Auricular confeſſion, but the whole matter of ſuch a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is left undefined?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whither if our Saviour (had done that which it is plain he hath not, that is,) had here inſtituted and appointed all thoſe things, which by the church of <hi>Rome</hi> are required as the material parts of Penance, yet this could have been a Sacrament?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, we have no more to do but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the force and ſignification of this word <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> Now that in the common uſe of men (eſpecially of thoſe which ſpeak diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and underſtandingly) implies a ſetting up <hi>de novo</hi> or the appointing
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:98824:234"/> that to become a duty, which was not knowable, or at leaſt not known to be ſo before it became ſo appointed. For this word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> is that which we uſe to expreſs a poſitive command by, in oppoſition to that which is Moral in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural obligation. Now it is very evident that all things of this Nature ought to be appointed very plainly and expreſly, or elſ they can carry no obligation with them; for ſeing the whole Reaſon of their becoming matter of Law or Duty, lies in the will of the Legiſlator, if that be not plainly diſcovered, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be inſtituted, and ſo there can be no Obligation to obſerve them, becauſe <hi>where there is no Law there can be no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;</hi> and a Law is no Law in effect which is not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged. Is it not therefore a very ſtrange thing to tell us of an Inſtitution by implication only, and yet at the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Seſſ. 14. c.</hi> 2.</note> ſame time to tell us that the matter ſo (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be) inſtituted, is no leſs then abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to the Salvation of Sinners?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond of theſe will eaſily be reſolved by conſidering what we obſerved before from the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Seſſ. 14. C.</hi> 3.</note> Council of <hi>Trent, viz.</hi> that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance conſiſts of Matter and Form; the Form is the Prieſts Abſolution, but the Matter or Materials of this Sacrament are Contrition, Confeſſion to a Prieſt, and Satisfaction or Performance of the Penance enjoyn'd by him; now it is evident that not only Auricular Confeſſion (of which we have ſpoken hitherto, but alſo Contrition and Satisfaction are wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and paſt over in ſilence by the Evangeliſt in this paſſage of Scripture, from whence they fetch their Sacrament of Penance: and is it not a wonderfully ſtrange thing, that our Savionr ſhould be ſuppoſed to inſtitut a Sacrament without any Materials of it at all? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore this muſt be either a very <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sacrament, or none at all.</p>
                  <p>Let us gueſs at the probability of this in proportion to either of the other undoubted Sacraments. Suppoſe our Saviour inſtead of that accurat form in which he inſtituted the Euchariſt had only ſaid I would have you my Diſciples and all that ſhall believe on my Name to keep a Memorial of me when I am gone: Or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſaid onely as he doth, <hi>John 6. 55. My Fleſh is Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and my Blood is Drink indeed;</hi> would any one have concluded here, that our Saviour in ſo ſaying, had appointed Bread and Wine to be conſecrated, to be received in ſuch a manner, and in a word that he had (without more ado) inſtituted ſuch a Sacrament as we uſually celebrate? No certainly, and therefore we ſee our Saviour is the moſt expreſs and particular therein that can be, <hi>for he takes Bread, bleſſes it, breakes it, gives it to them, ſaying, Take eat, this is my Body, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:98824:234"/> and <hi>after Supper he takes the Cup, bleſſes it, gives it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of this, for this is the New Teſtament in my Blood, &amp;c.</hi> and then adds, <hi>Do this in remembrance of Me.</hi> Now who is there that obſerves this accuracy of our Saviour in the Euchariſt, can imagine that he ſhould intend to inſtitute a Sacrament of Penance, and that as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation (in the Opinion of the <hi>Romaniſts)</hi> as the other, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this Form of words, <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. and without the leaſt mention of Confeſſion, Contrition, or any other Material or neceſſary Part or Circumſtance of it.</p>
                  <p>2. But in the third and laſt place, let us ſuppoſe that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had in the Text before us inſtituted Penance, and had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly all thoſe things, which they call the Material parts of it, (as it is evident he hath not) yet even then, and upon that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Penance would not have proved to be a Sacrament properly ſo called.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs according to a looſe acceptation of the word Sacrament, ſomething may be ſaid for it; for ſo there are many things have had the name of Sacrament applyed to them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſomewhere calls <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Ax the Sacrament of Wood, and in his Book againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> he ſtiles the whole Chriſtian Religion a Sacrament. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places calls Bread, Fiſh, the Rock, and the Myſtery of Number, Sacraments, for he hath given us a general Rule in his Fifth Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> That all ſigns when they belong to divine things are called Sacrament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: And in conſideration hereof it is acknowledged by <hi>Caſſander,</hi> that the Number of Sacraments was indefinite in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, until the times of <hi>Peter Lombard.</hi> But all this notwithſtanding, and properly ſpeaking, this Rite of Penance taking it altogether (and even ſuppoſing whatſoever the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can ſuppoſe to belong to it) cannot be reputed a Sacrament, according to the allowed definitions of a Sacrament delivered by their own Divines.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:98824:235"/> inſtitution of Sacraments to condeſcend to our weakneſs, and thereby to give us ſenſible Tokens or Pleges of what he had promiſed in his Written word, to the intent that our dulneſs might be relieved, and our Faith aſſiſted; foraſmuch as herein, our Eyes and other ſenſes, as well as our Ears are made Witneſſes of his gracious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus by Baptiſmal waſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng he gives us a ſenſible token and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of our regeneration, and the waſhing away of our ſins by the Blood of Chriſt; and by the participation of Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper we have a Token and Symbol of our Union with Chriſt, our Friendſhip with God and communion with each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now it is manifeſt there is no ſuch thing as this in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance (as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſes.) For they do not ſay or mean that the Abſolution of the Prieſt is a Token or Emblem of God's forgiveneſs, but that the Prieſt actually pardons in God's ſtead, by Vertue of a Power delegated to him. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, here muſt be a Sacrament, not only without any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts inſtituted, but alſo without any thing Figurative, Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Significative which ſeems to be as expreſly contrary to their own Doctrine in the aforeſaid definitions as to the truth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nay, farther to evince the difference of this Rite of Penance from all other proper Sacraments; it deſerves obſervation, that whereas in thoſe other acknowledged Sacraments, the Prieſt in God's Name delivers to us the Pledges and Symbols of Divine Grace, Here in this of Penance we muſt bring all the material parts and Pledges our ſelves, and preſent them to God, or to the Prieſt in his ſtead: My meaning is, that whereas (for inſtance) in Baptiſm the Prieſt applies to us the Symbol of Water, and in the Euchariſt delivers to us the conſecrated Elements in token of the Divine Grace, contrary-wiſe here in Penance we muſt on our parts bring with us contrition, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſatisfaction too, in which reſpect we may be rather ſaid to give Pledges to God, then he to us; which is widely different from the Nature of other Sacraments, and ſeems no leſs to be contrary to the reaſon and Notion of a Sacrament in general.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of what we have hitherto diſcourſed, amounts to this; Firſt, That here is no Auricular confeſſion inſtituted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 22. As was pretended. Secondly, Not, any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance in which it can be included or implied; no nor indeed any Sacrament at all.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I might have ſpared all the words I have uſed in proving the latter, for ſo long as I have made appear that private confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not inſtituted, it was not ſo very material to conſider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther penance could be a Sacrament or no; but this I added to ſhew the imperious dictates of that church, and their extravagancy in impoſing the moſt ſacred Names upon their own inventions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:98824:235"/> to give them the greater veneration with the People.</p>
                  <p>And thus I would diſmiſs the firſt part of my undertaking, yet the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not forego their pretenſions for Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for they will yet urge, that wihther or no we will call it a Sacrament which our Saviour inſtitutes in the Text before us, it is however certain here is a Power conferred on the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, of remitting and retaining ſins; for by theſe words, <hi>Whoſeſoever ſins ye remit they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. *Our Saviour had made the <note place="margin">

                     <q>To what purpoſe ſhould I Confeſs my ſins to Men who cannot heal my wounds? For how ſhall they (who know nothing of my heart but by my own Confeſſion) know whither I ſay true or no? For no one knowes what is in Man, but the Spirit of Man that is in him.

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though we grant our Saviour hath given the Prieſt Authority to Remit and Retain ſins, yet how doth it appear that this extends to Secret ſins; ſins in thought only, or as the Council expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it againſt the ninth and tenth Commandments? Of open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ins and
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:98824:236"/> publick ſcandals the Church hath cognizance, and hath a right which ſhe may inſiſt upon, or recede from, if ſhe ſee cauſe, becauſe ſuch ſins are an injury to the Society as well as an offence againſt God, and therefore here the Officers of the Church may diſpenſe her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Remit or Retain (as we ſhall ſee more by and by;) but in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins where only GOD is injured, and to that which he is only privy, what hath the Church to do, unleſs they be volunlarily diſcovered to her? Otherwiſe they are properly reſerved Caſes to the Tribunal of God</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I would be bold to enquire farther, why may not ſins eſpecially ſuch as we laſt named, be Remitted upon Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, without Confeſſion to the Prieſt alſo? And I the rather ask this for theſe two reaſons, Firſt I obſerve that this very Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, that until the times <note place="margin">Seſſ. 14, c. 1.</note> of our Saviour, and his Inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſins were remitted upon contrition only, and application to the mercies of God, without Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. They cannot therefore now ſay, remiſſion implies this Confeſſion, for that cannot be ſaid to be implied in the nature of a thing, when the thing it ſelf can be had without it.</p>
                  <p>They will anſwer that it is ſufficient, that it is now made neceſſary by our Saviour. But I reply, Then that Inſtitution which now makes it neceſſary, muſt be better proved then yet it hath been, or elſe Men will be very apt to hope they may now under the Goſpel obtain Pardon (at leaſt) upon as eaſie terms as it was to be had at before.</p>
                  <p>My Second reaſon of asking that third Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this; I obſerve that their own School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">Aquinas ſumm. part. 3. Q. 68.</note> acknowledge ſins to be remitted under the Goſpel by the Prieſt without any Confeſſion to Men, particularly in the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, by which it plainly appears, that Confeſſion is not implied in the nature of Remiſſion, but one may be had without the other, and then why may not a ſinner after Baptiſm, hope for Pardon upon his contrite and devout application to the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without this new device and pick-lock of Conſcience, Auricular Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>But ſo much for that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. I proceed now to the ſecond thing propounded, namely, to inquire hiſtorically whither or no Auricular, or ſuch a ſecret, and Sacramental Confeſſion, as aforeſaid, hath been of conſtant and univerſal uſe in the Chriſtian Church, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend, and as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> aſſerts, <hi>Seſſi.</hi> 14 Chap. 5.</p>
                  <p>This inquiry is not into matter of Law or Divine Right, as the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:98824:236"/> former was, but of Fact only, yet nevertheleſs it is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a double account:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this is the ground which the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Canoniſts wholly went upon, (as I noted before;) they exploded all pretence of Divine Inſtitution in the caſe, as having more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty (it ſeems) then to pretend ſo high upon no better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or at leaſt they contented themſelves to preſcribe for it only upon the Authority of conſtant and univerſal practice; now if we ſhew the falſeneſs of this ground, as well as of the other, then will their Hypotheſis of Auricular Confeſſion have no foot to ſtand upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Credit of what hath been already ſaid under the former head, doth very much depend upon this, and that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will be confirmed or impaired reſpectively to what ſhall be evidently made out in this ſecond point. Foraſmuch as if on the one ſide it be made apparent that ſuch a Rite hath been of conſtant uſe in the Chriſtian Church, it will afford a great preſumption that it took its riſe at firſt from Divine Inſtitution, notwithſtanding all we have offered to the contrary. So on the other ſide, if the Evidence here anſwer not the Pretenſion; and no ſufficient foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of conſtant and univerſal practice appear: Then will all that which we have hitherto diſcourſed, be greatly ſtrengthened and confirmed; becauſe it is by no means probable, that if there had been a Divine Law in the caſe, that ſuch a thing would have been generally neglected by the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>Now for the clearing of this, though I am here only upon the defenſive, and ſo bound to no more then to examine the proofs which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bring for their pretenſions, yet I will deal ingenuouſly, as ſeeking not to find Flaws, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Truth, and therefore give theſe inſtances as ſo many reaſons for the Negative.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place I crave leave to premiſe this: If Auricular Confeſſion were ſo great a Goſpel myſtery, ſo wonderfully effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a method of ſaving Souls, as to be typified in the Law (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> teach) as well as inſtituted in the Goſpel and practiſed by the whole Church, one might ſeem juſtly to wonder how it comes to paſs that there ſhould be no mention, nor appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it in the whole courſe of our Saviours own Miniſtry; he uſed to be an example, as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:98824:237"/> had been but to make way for the Underſtanding of ſo obſcure an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; ſince eſpecially, one would have thought to find ſome Traces of this in the Miniſtry of our Saviour, becauſe he daily converſed with ſinners he reproved them, inſtructed them, healed them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them, but never brought any of them to ſuch a Confeſſion as we are treating of; <hi>viz.</hi> To a particular enumeration of their ſins, with the circumſtances, nor upon ſo doing formally abſolved them. His very Diſciples (ſome of which had been great ſinners) were admitted without it; the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> was told her by him all that ever ſhe did, but ſhe was not brought on her knees to make her own Confeſſion; but moſt ſtrange of all it is, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in Adultery, when he had made her accuſers ſlink away, was not privately brought to it; it may be they will ſay, there was no need of Confeſſion to him who knew all before, but yet it might have been neceſſary to bring theſe Sinners to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of themſelves by that means to work Repentance, and fit them for Pardon, at leaſt if this Method had been of ſuch mighty uſe and wonderful neceſſity as is pretended.</p>
                  <p>2. But to let paſs that; in the next place it is matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that nothing of this practice appears in the Miniſtry of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; they went about preaching the Goſpel, calling Men to Repentance, erecting and governing Churches, but never ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down in a Confeſſors chair for Penitents, ſecretly to tell them in their Ear, the ſtory of their vicious Lives; indeed we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18. That ſome came <hi>in and ſhewed their deeds;</hi> but firſt it was voluntary, and in a fit of Holy Zeal, for we cannot find that they were required to do it, as of a Sacramental Obligation; and beſides, the Confeſſion was publick before the Church, not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and whiſpered in ſecret; it is true alſo that St. <hi>James chap.</hi> 5. 16. adviſes the Chriſtians to confeſs their faults one to another, (which is made a mighty evidence in this Caſe;) but it is as true, that this was ſpoken in an extraordinary caſe, as appears verſe 14. in bodily ſickneſs and diſtreſs of Conſcience, they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to lay open their condition, in order to Relief and Succour, by the more ardent and affectionate Prayers of thoſe who ſhould be privy to it, but it is not made a ſtanding and univerſal Rule for all Men to comply with it, whither they be ſick or well, in proſperity or adverſity, perplexed or quiet in their Conſciences, much leſs of Sacramental and Neceſſary Obligation, as in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>3. Let us go on in the next Ages after the Apoſtles, for about two hundred years we hear not one word of this kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which we enquire for. Indeed the Writings of that time which are extant, are not many, but if this buſineſs had Been
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:98824:237"/> of ſuch conſequence as is pretended, it is ſtrange that thoſe Holy Men <hi>Ignatius, Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> ſhould not have made mention of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings us one inſtance within this Period, and that is from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpeaking of certain Women who had been abuſed by <hi>Marcion</hi> the Heretick, ſaith they afterwards came and confeſſed, with ſhame and ſorrow, to the Church.

                  <p>4. In <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, which was alſo much about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after our Saviour, we find great things ſaid of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but it is of that which was publick, and in the face of the Church, not to a Prieſt in a Corner, and this indeed was greatly incouraged and required by the Holy Men of thoſe times, as that which in the Caſe of open and ſcandalous ſins, freed the Church both from the guilt, and from the reproach of them, and in the caſe of ſecret ſins, was a means (by open ſhame) to bring Men to Repentance, and ſo to Pardon. And the confeſſion was principally directed to God, who was the perſon offended by the ſin, yet it was made before Men to raiſe a fervency in their Prayers, as is noted before, and to obtain their effectual interceſſion with God on behalf of the penitent. This that Ancient writer makes manifeſt to be his Senſe in his Book <hi>de Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> in theſe words <hi>Plerumque vero jejuniis preces alere, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcere, lachrymari, &amp; mugire dies nocteſque ad Dominum Deum tuum, Presbyteris advolvi, &amp; aris</hi> (or rather <hi>charis) Dei ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniculari, omnibus fratribus legationes ſuae deprecationis injungere, haec omnia ex homologeſis ut poenitentiam commendet, &amp;c.</hi> The peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent often joyns Faſting to his Prayers, Weeps, Wails and moans night and day before God, caſts himſelf at the feet of the Prieſts, kneels to all holy people, <note place="margin">Tertull.

                  <p>Thus we have traced the current of Antiquity for Four or Five hundred years to ſearch for the Head of this <hi>Nilus,</hi> the ſource and riſe of that kind of Confeſſion which is ſo highly magnified by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but hitherto we have found nothing of it, and this methinks ſhould be ſufficient to ſtagger an impartial inquirer, (at leaſt it is as much as can be expected in ſo ſhort a Treanſe as this is intended to be) and may ſatisfy the unprejudicat that there is little of Antiquity to favour this Rite, as there is of Divine Inſtitution to be pleaded for it.

I obſerve that whereas this word <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> is commonly uſed by diverſe of the Fathers, as the Phraſe whereby they intend to expreſs the whole nature of Repentance in all the parts and branches of it, as is evident by the paſſage I cited out of <hi>Tertullian de Poenit.</hi> even now, and is acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf; nevertheleſs, merely becauſe that word ſignifies Confeſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and nothing elſe, theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Sophiſters, where they find this word <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi> force it into an Argument for that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which they contend for; and ſo ſeveral Diſcourſes of the Fathers concerning Repentance in general, are made to be nothing but <hi>Exhortations</hi> to, or <hi>Encomiums</hi> of Confeſſion in particular, and that muſt be nothing elſe neither but Auricular Confeſſion, tho thing in Queſtion.

But ſhe proceeding on very particularly in her confeſſions, at laſt amongſt other things comes to declare that a certain Deacon of that church had lien with her; upon notice of which horrid Fact, the Deacon is forthwith caſhier'd and caſt out of the church: By which means the miſcarriage takes Air, and coming to the knowledge of the People; they preſently fall into a mighty commotion and rage about it; partly in deteſtation of ſo foul an Action of the Deacon, but principally in contemplation of the Diſhonour and Scandal thereby reflected on the whole Church. The Biſhop finding the Honour of the whole Body of his Clergy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly concern'd in this accident, and being very anxious what to do in this caſe, at laſt by the Council of one <hi>Eudaemon</hi> a Preſbyter of that Church, he reſolves thenceforth to aboliſh the Office of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, both to extinguiſh the preſent flame, and to prevent the like occaſion for the future; and now by this means every Man is left to the conduct of his own Conſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is the matter of fact faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rendered from the words of the Hiſtorian; but this if we take it in the groſs, and look no farther then ſo, will not do much towards the deciding of the preſent controverſie, we will therefore examine things a little more narrowly by the help of ſuch hints as thoſe Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters afford us, perhaps we may make good uſe of it at laſt; and to this purpoſe,</p>

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:98824:240"/> in ſecret; notwithſtanding upon a more thorough view it will appear quite another thing from that pleaded for, and practiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that eſpecially in the reſpects follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Firſt, In the Auricular Confeſſion in the Story, there is ſome remainder of the ancient Diſcipline of the Church (whoſe Confeſſions uſed to be open and publick, as I have ſhewed) in that here a publick Officer is appointed by the Church to receive them, ſuch an one as whoſe Prudence, and Learning, and Piety ſhe could confide in for a buſineſs of ſo great nicety and difficulty, and it is neither left to the Penitent to chooſe his confident for his Confeſſor, nor at large for every Prieſt to repreſent the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church in ſo tickliſh an Affair as that of Diſcipline, but to a publick Officer appointed by the Church for this purpoſe; ſo that Confeſſion to him cannot be ſaid to be private, ſeing it is done to the whole Church by him. To confirm which, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Penitentiary it ſeems was bound (as there was occaſion) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the matters (opened to him in ſecret) to the Church, as appears in the Crime of the Deacon in the Story; there was no pretence of a Sale of Confeſſion in this Caſe, as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Vertue of which a Man may confeſs and go on to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſecretly, without danger of being brought upon the Stage, whatſoever the atrocity of his Crime be, and indeed without any effectual courſe in Order to his Repentance and Reformation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Confeſſion in the Story doth not pretend to be of abſolute neceſſity as if a Mans ſins might not be pardoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but only a prudent Proviſion of the Church to help Men forward in their Repentance, to direct the Acts and Expreſſions of it, and eſpecially to relieve perplexed and weak Conſciences, and to aſſiſt them in their preparations for the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and this appears, amongſt other things, by the account which the Hiſtorian gives us of the conſequence of aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, <hi>viz.</hi> That now every Man is left to his own conſcience about his partaking of the holy Myſteries; but it is not ſaid or intimated that he was left under the guilt of his Sins, for want of Confeſſion. To which add in the laſt place, that this Office what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, was not reputed a Sacrament, but rather, as I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, an expedient to prepare men for it, for doubtleſs neither that Biſhop, nor that Church would have ever conſented to the abolition of a Sacrament, for the ſake of ſuch a Scandal as happen'd in the miſmanagement of it, or if they had done ſo, much leſs can it be imagined that the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Church would have concurred with them in it, as we ſhall by and by ſee they did.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I obſerve concerning the beginning of this Penitentiary
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:98824:240"/> Office, the time and occaſion of this uſage; namely, that the Hiſtorians do not pretend it to have been Apoſtolical, much leſs of ſtrictly Divine Inſtitution, but they lay the Heat of its firſt riſe about the time of the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution, which was about Two hundred years after our Saviour, I confeſs <hi>Nicephorus</hi> would perſwade us of its greater <note place="margin">Nicephor, <hi>Lib, 12. Cap. 28.</hi>
                     </note> Antiquity, and that it was rather revived, then inſtituted at that time, for he ſpeaking of the bringing it into uſe at the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution ſaith, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticco canoni heremenos, i. e.</hi> The Church purſuant of the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Canons conſtituted a Penitentiary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is ſo addicted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hypotheſis, as very unreaſonably to favour this Conceit; but the Truth ſeems to be (as <hi>Valeſius</hi> very ingenuouſly acknowledges) only this, that here was a miſtake of the import of the words of the Hiſtorian, who ſaith only that when the Church had choſen their Penitentiary <hi>canoni proſetheſan,</hi> they added him to the Canon, that is to the number of thoſe in the <hi>Matricula</hi> or Roll of ſuch as were to be maintained in and by the Church, or as we would ſay they made him Canon of the Church; not that he was Conſtituted in ſuch an Office, purſuant of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter Law or Canon, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> careleſly or wilfully miſtakes Beſides afterwards when the Hiſtorian obſerves that the Novatians univerſally withſtood this Order from the beginning of it, he calls it <hi>proſtheken tauten q. d.</hi> This new Inſtitution, or Addition, or Supplement of the Ancient Rites of the Church; ſo that there is no reaſon we ſhould date this Inſtitution higher then the Hiſtorian doth. namely, after the <hi>Decian</hi> Perſecution.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhould be the ground and reaſons of erecting this new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Officer in the Church then, if it was not before? Of this I give two accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Church being now very numerous, and the Zeal and Devotion very great; and what by the compaſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which the Church gave to Penitents, and her ardent Prayers for them, what by the earneſt harangues of Holy Men to move People to repentance, abundance were inclined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their ſins, and this confeſſion being till that time accuſtomed to be open, and publick in the face of the congregation, it muſt needs happen (all thoſe circumſtances conſidered together) that a great many things would be brought upon the Stage, the Publication of which would be attended with great inconveniences; for ſome ſins are of that Nature, that they ſcarce can take Air without ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contagion, ſome confeſſions would make ſport for light and vain Perſons, and beſides abundance of other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (eaſy to be imagined by any one) the publication of ſome
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:98824:241"/> ſins might expoſe the Penitents to the ſeverity of the Pagan crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judge; upon theſe and ſuch like conſiderations, the church thought fit therefore (as I have intimated before) to appoint one wiſe and very grave Perſon in her ſteed to receive the confeſſions; who by this diſcretion might ſo determinat matters, that what things were fit for ſilence, might have private Methods applied to them, but what were fit to be brought upon the Stage, might be made Publick examples of, or receive a Publick remedy,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But the Hiſtorian leads us to a more ſpecial Reaſon of this Inſtitution at that time; namely, that the rage of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Perſecution cruelly ſhock the Church, and abundance of her weaker members fell off in the Storm, and which was worſt of all the Church was diſtracted about the reſtitution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or final rejection of thoſe that bad ſo miſcarried; for though the beſt and wiſeſt of the Church were ſo merciful and conſiderate of humane infirmity, as to be willing to receive thoſe in again, upon Repentance, over whom the Temptation of fear had too much prevailed, yet the Novatians a great and Zealous part of Chriſtianity, looked upon ſuch as deſperate, who had once broken their baptiſmal Vow, and would rather ſeperate from the Church themſelves, then ſuffer ſuch to be reſtored to it. Here the Church was in a great ſtrait, either ſhe muſt be very ſevere to ſome, or ſhe ſhall ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to others, ſhe muſt either let the weak periſh or ſhe muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them that counted themſelves ſtrong. Now in this caſe ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both tenderly compaſſionat towards thoſe that had fallen, and withal willing to ſatisfie thoſe Novatian Diſſenters, or at leaſt to deliver her ſelf from Scandal, takes this courſe, ſhe requires that thoſe who had fallen, and deſired to be reſtored again to her Society ſhould acknowledge their faults, and make all the Penitent ſatisfaction that was poſſible for them to perform, that ſo neither they may be too eaſily tempted to do ſo again by the gentleneſs of the remedy, nor the Novatians rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ch her Lenity, or take pet as if no difference was made between the ſound and the lapſed; for theſe cauſes, though the moſt publick Penance was thought little enough to be undergone by the lapſed; but yet on the other ſide, conſidering wiſely the inconveniences of publick Penance in ſome caſes (as I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before) ſhe therefore took this middle courſe; namely ſhe appointed a publick Confeſſor, who having firſt heard privatly the ſeveral caſes of the Penitents, ſhould bring into publick, only ſuch of them as (without incurring any of the aforſaid dangers) might be made examplary. And this appears to be the true reaſon of this Inſtitution, and the bottom of this affair, by this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage in the Hiſtorian; That whereas the generality of the Orthodox cloſed preſently with this wiſe temperament, the Novatians
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:98824:241"/> only, thoſe conceited Non-conformiſts, rejected <hi>proſiheken tauten</hi> this expedient as a new invention; they were too humourſome to comply with ſuch a temperament.</p>
                  <p>But here another Queſtion ariſes, <hi>viz.</hi> How far this new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient was imbraced by the Orthodox Churches, for if it was only received by that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Authority would not be ſo great; for it is poſſible to imagine, that other Churches might allow every private Prieſt to confeſs, and ſo admit of no publick Penitentiary.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that by the Hiſtory it ſeems plain enough, that this was not the peculiar manner of the Church of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> only, but the uſal Method in that time of moſt other Churches alſo; but I muſt needs ſay, I do not find that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> complied with them herein, though it was not much to her Honour to be ſingular, where there was ſo much Prudence and Piety to have inclined her to Uniformity. However this is gained, which is my point, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> countenanced in her practice of private and clancular confeſſions, by the general uſage of the Church; as they pretend.</p>
                  <p>3. I obſerve concerning this Office of Penitentiary, that as it was erected upon prudential conſiderations, ſo it was upon the ſame grounds aboliſhed, by the ſame Authority of the church which firſt inſtituted it, and that after about Two hundred years continuance in the time of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> as we have ſeen; and therein he was followed, ſaith <hi>Sozomen</hi> by almoſt all the Biſhops and Churches in the World: this therefore was far from being thought either a Divine or Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſtitution: <hi>Petavius</hi> would here perſwade us, that it was only publick confeſſion, and not private, which was upon this occaſion ſo generally laid aſide, as we have ſeen, but this is done by him more out of tenderneſs of Auricular Confeſſion, then upon good reaſon; and <hi>Valeſius</hi> goes beyond him, and will needs perſwade us that neither publick nor privat Confeſſion were put down in this juncture; but only that the lately erected Officer of Penetentiary was caſhier'd; but I muſt crave leave to ſay, there is no ſufficient reaſon for either of theſe conjectures, but on the contrary plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them, for <hi>Socrates,</hi> who is the firſt and principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later of this whole ſtory ſaith he was perſonally acquainted with this Presbyter <hi>Eudaemon,</hi> who gave the advice to <hi>Nectarius</hi> to make this change in the Diſcipline of the Church, and that he had the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid relation of it from his own Mouth, and expoſtulated with him about it, giving his reaſons to the contrary, and ſuggeſted his ſuſpicions that the ſtate of Piety would be much endamaged by this change, and in plain words tells him, that he had now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now this fear of his had been the abſurd eſt thing in the World, if upon this counſel and advice of his, only one certain Man in the Office of publick Confeſſioner had been laid aſide, but both the uſe of publick and privat Confeſſions had been kept up and retained.</p>
                  <p>But after all (for ought appears) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> kept her old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> ſhe tenacious of her own cuſtoms eſpecially of ſuch as may advance her Intereſt and Authority, complies not with this Innovation or Reformation (be it for better or worſe) but her Prieſts go on with their Confeſſions, and turn all Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt into Clancular Tranſactions, in deſpight of the example of other Churches.

                  <p>For the former part of this charge, if it be not evident enough already, it will be eaſily made out from the Premiſes, for they cannot deny that they make this kind of Confeſſion neceſſary to Salvation, at leaſt as neceſſary as Baptiſm it ſelf is, (ſuppoſing a Man hath ſinned after Baptiſm) now if it be neither made ſo by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, nor acknowledged to be ſo by the conſtant Opinion of the Church, what an horrible impoſition is here upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, when in the higheſt and worſt ſenſe that can be they teach <hi>for Doctrines the commandements of Men,</hi> and make Salvation harder then GOD hath made it, and ſuſpend mens hopes upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms then he hath done? if it was preſcribed by the preſent Church as a matter of Order and Diſcipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only, or of convenience and expediency, we ſhould never boggle at it upon this account, or diſpute the point with them; or if it was only declared neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> upon extraordinary emergency, by the peculiar condition of the Penitent, his weakneſs of Jugdment, the perplexity of

All the circumſtances are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and how can he tell which are they that change the ſpecies of the Act, unleſs he be as great a School-man as his Confeſſor.

                     </gap>; therefore it is neceſſary for him (by conſequence) to confeſs all Venial ſins too, and then where ſhall the poor Man begin, or when, ſhall he make an end? Such a <hi>Carnificina</hi> ſuch a rack and torture, in a word, ſuch an holy Inquiſition is this buſineſs of Auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion become. And that eminent Divine of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> (of whom <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Rhenanus</hi> ſpeaks) ſeems very well to have underſtood both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and this matter who pronounces that <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> had with their tricks, and ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But for the ſecond part of this impeachment, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confeſſion now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is miſchievous to Piety; This remains yet to be demonſtrated, and we will do it the rather in this place, becauſe it will be an abundant confirmation of all that hath been diſcourſed under the two former heads; and might indeed have ſaved the labour of them, but that we were unwilling to leave any pretence of theirs undiſcuſed; for if this practice of their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> appear to be miſchievous to Piety, it will never by any ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Man be thought either to have been inſtituted by our Saviour, or to have been the ſenſe and uſage of the Catholick
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:98824:243"/> Church, whatever they pretend on its behalf.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore this laſt and important part of my charge I make good by theſe Three Articles following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This Method of theirs is dangerous to Piety, as it is very apt to cheat People into an Opinion that they are in a better condition then truly they are, or may be in towards God, as that their ſins are pardoned, and diſcharged by him, when there is no ſuch matter. The Church-men of <hi>Rome</hi> complain of the Doctrine of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e reformed Divings touching aſſurance of Salvation, that it fills men with too great confidence, and renders them careleſs and preſumptuous; but whatſoever there is in that, it is not my buſineſs now to diſpute it, however methinks it will not very well become a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> to aggravate it, till he have acquitted himſelf in the point before us; for by this Aſſurance Office of theirs they comply too much with the ſelf-flattery of Mens own Hearts, they render Men ſecure, before they are ſafe, and furniſh them with a confidence like that of the Whore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>who wipes her Mouth, and ſaith I have done no evil.</hi> For Men return from the Confeſſors Chair (as they are made to believe) as Pure as from the Font, and as Innocent as from their Mothers womb: as if God was concluded by the act of the Prieſt, and as if he being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an humble poſture, a dejected look, and a lamentable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, God Almighty would be put off ſo too.</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Perhaps they will ſay this is the fault and folly of the Men, not of the Inſtitution of the Church: But why do they not teach them better then? Nay, why do they countenance and incourage them in ſo dangerous miſtakes? For whither elſe tend thoſe words in the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent, ipſi Deo reconciliandis? q. d.</hi> that by this way of confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> men are reconciled to the <note place="margin">ſeſſ. 14. Can. 1</note> Divine Majeſty himſelf; or thoſe other forcited, where the Prieſt is ſaid to be the <hi>Vicar of Chriſt, and in</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, what is the natural tendency of all this, but to make People believe that their Salvation or Damnation is in the Power of the Prieſt, that he is a little God Almighty, and his diſcharge would certainly paſs current in the Court of Heaven. But
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:98824:243"/> there is ſophiſtry and juggle in all this, as I thus make appear; for,</p>

                  <p>But now in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the caſe is otherwiſe; there the Prieſt ſuſtains the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and is not ſo much his Delegate as his plenipotentiary, and his pardon is as full and good as if the Judge of the World had pronounced it <hi>pro Tribunali;</hi> ſo that if the moſt lewd and habitual ſinner have but the good fortune to go out of the World under the Bleſſing of his Ghoſtly Father, that is to ſay, either death came ſo ſoon after his laſt Abſolution, or the prieſt came ſo opportunely after his laſt ſin, that he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a new ſcore, he is ſure to go Heaven without more ado.

If they intended this only for abſolution from the Cenſures of the Church it might be called Charity, and look ſomething like the practice of the Primitive Church, which releaſed thoſe upon their Death-beds, whom it would not diſcharge all their lives before tho' not then neither without ſigns of Attrition and contrition too. but theſe pretend to quite another thing; namely to releaſe men <hi>in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> and to give them a Paſs-port to Heaven without Repentance, which is a very ſtrange thing, to ſay no worſe of it. Or to inſtance one thing more, what is the meaning of their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of giving Abſolution before the Penance is performed (as is uſual with them) unleſs this be it, that whither the Man make any Conſcience at all how he lives hereafter, yet he is pardoned as much as the Prieſt can do it for him, and is not this a likely way of Reformation?</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore now upon the whole matter that Auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is only ane Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of greatning the Prieſt, and pleaſing the People; a trick of gratifying the undevout and impious, as well as the Devout and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; the latter it impoſes upon by its outward appearance of Humility and Piety; to the former it ſerves for a palliative Cure of the Gripes of Conſcience, which they are now and then troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; in reality it tends to make ſin eaſie and tolerable by the cheapneſs of its Pardon, and in a word, it is nothing but the Old Diſcipline of the Church in Duſt and Aſhes. And therefore though the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Liturgy, piouſly wiſhes for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the Ancient Diſcipline of the Church, it can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her that ſhe troubles not her ſelf with this Rubbiſh.</p>

                  <head>A POST-SCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>AFter I had finiſhed the foregoing Papers, and moſt part of them had alſo paſt the Preſs, I happened to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there was a Book juſt then come over from <hi>France,</hi> written by a Divine of the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> which with great appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Learning maintained the juſt contrary to what <hi>I</hi> had aſſerted (eſepecially in the Hiſtorical part of this Queſtion) and pretended to prove from the moſt Ancient Monuments of the Holy Scriptures, Fathers, Popes and Councils, that Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion had been the conſtant Doctrine, and Univerſal and Uninterrupted uſage of the Chriſtian Church for near 1300 years from the Times of our Saviour to the <hi>Laterane</hi> council.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>I</hi> heard this, I heartily wiſhed, that either the ſaid Book had come out a little ſooner, or at leaſt that my Papers had been yet in my hands; to the intent that it might have been in my Power, to have corrected what might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or ſupplied what was defective in that ſhort Diſcourſe, or indeed if occaſion were, to have wholly ſuppreſt it.</p>
                  <p>For as ſoon as I entered upon the ſaid Book, and found from no leſs a Man then the Author himſelf, that he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read over all that had been written on both ſides of this controverſy, and that this work of his was the product of Eighteen years ſtudy, and that in the prime of his years, and moſt flouriſhing time of his parts, that it was publiſhed upon the matureſt deliberation on his part, and with the greateſt applauſe and approbation of the Faculty, I thought I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect, whither a ſmall Tract, written in haſt by a Man of no Name, and full enough of other Buſineſs, could be fit to be ſeen on the ſame Day with ſo el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>borate a work.</p>
                  <p>But by that time I had read a little further, I took Heart, and permitted the Preſs to go on; and now, that <hi>I</hi> have gone over the whole, I do here profeſs ſincerely, that in all that learned Diſcourſe I ſcarcely found any thing which I had
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:98824:247"/> not foreſeen, and as I think in ſome meaſure prevented. But certain I am, nothing occurred that ſtaggered my Judgment, or which did not rather confirm me in what I had written; for though I met with abundance of Citations, and a great deal of Wit, and Dexterity in the management of them, yet I found none of them come home to the point; for whereas they ſometimes recommend and preſs Confeſſion of Sin in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſometimes to the Church, ſometimes to the Prieſt or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop as well as to God Almighty: Again ſometimes they ſpeak great things of the Dignity of the Prieſt-hood, and the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Or where is the Univerſal neceſſity of it aſſerted? Or that ſecret ſins committed after Baptiſm, are by no other means, or upon no other terms pardoned with God, then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their being confeſſed to men? In theſe things lies the hinge of our diſpute, and of theſe particulars one ought in Reaſon to expect the moſt direct and plain proof imaginable, if the matter was of ſuch Conſequence, of ſuch Univerſal practice and notoriety as they pretend; but nothing of all this appears in this Writter more then in thoſe that have gone before him. In contemplation of which I now adventure this little Tract in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, with ſomewhat more of Confidence then I ſhould have done, had it not been for this occaſion,</p>
                  <p>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to be too partial in the Caſe, or to give too ſlight an account of this Learned Man's performance, the Reader who pleaſes ſhall be judge by a ſpecimen or two which I will here briefly repreſent to him.</p>
                  <p>The former of them ſhall be the very firſt argument or Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony he produces for his Aſſertion, which I the rather make my choice to give inſtance in, becauſe no Man can be ſaid ingenuouſly to ſeek for faults, to pick and chooſe for matter of exception, that takes the firſt thing that comes to hand.</p>

                  <p>And here is Penance impoſed for a ſecret ſin: True when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come publick.</p>
                  <p>And here is a different degree of Penance impoſed upon him that ingenuouſly confeſſes, from him that ſtays till he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and hath his ſin proved upon him: And good Reaſon, for the one gave tokens of Repentance, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her none.

                  <p>If this be a clear and proper Argument for the neceſſity of of Auricular confeſſion, God help poor <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> that cannot diſcern it; but oh the Wit of Man, and the Power of Learning and Logick! What may not ſuch Men prove if they have a mind to it?</p>
